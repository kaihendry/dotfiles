13:30 < draq> It took me ages to figure out how to move a ship
13:31 < Lucrece> your first game?
13:33 < Ayeloria> well, now we are seasoned professionals in our second game...
13:33 < Lucrece> too bad we never got to play it as Space Battlegrounds...
13:33 <+Iso|AroundMaybe> like us old folk...
13:33 < Ayeloria> Yes...the old ones...
13:34 < Xmo> who's winning game 2 at the moment?
13:34 < Ayeloria> who need young blood to teach them a lesson!
13:34 < Ayeloria> Who knows?
13:34 < Ayeloria> Winning is such a relative term? Is it who has the most planets? the most ships? the most research? Hmmmm....
13:35 < Xmo> population at this stage
13:35 < Lucrece> I'd say it's a little early to say who's winning...
13:35 < Ayeloria> well that would depend on who got the most Js! That doesn't count! Those of us with bigger planets have the highest max pops!
13:35 < draq> Yes this is my first game
13:36 < Xmo> research wont help if you dont have planets
13:36 < Xmo> yo kai
13:36 < Ayeloria> yeah...that's true!
13:36 < Ayeloria> Which is why my research is low and I'm working on getting planets!
13:36 < Lucrece> Reno has the highest pop at 2,292,849
13:36 < Ayeloria> Would be nice if we knew who had the most planets or the highest max pops...
13:37 < Xmo> kai, what made you join this game?
13:37 < draq> Xmo: Oh you Cosmo :)
13:37 < draq> Xmo: Summer
13:37 < Xmo> xmo is cosmo on mobile phone irc
13:37 < draq> Xmo: Enjoy Xmen2?
13:37 < Xmo> yeah, not bad
13:38 < Xmo> better than the first
13:38 < Ayeloria> hmmm have I cracked the 2 million mark yet...
13:38 < draq> Xmo: maybe think about you&mel and bath again. heh
13:38 < Lucrece> Xmo, are you playing game 2?
13:38 < Xmo> i am
13:39 < Xmo> that was a good few years ago now. scary
13:39 < Ayeloria> 1.992 current pop...7.4 max pop!
13:39 < Lucrece> heh...I've got a higher current pop :)
13:40 < Xmo> 2,292,849 current pop :)
13:40 < Ayeloria> you got a J Luc!
13:40 < Lucrece> ahh...so that would make you Reno! :)
13:40 < Lucrece> I was wondering who you were...
13:40 < Ayeloria> Yeah, he's given it away!
13:40 < draq> So how do I increase pop? More planets?
13:41 < Ayeloria> yep...and then just wait for them to grow!
13:41 < Ayeloria> how many planets do you guys have?
13:41 -!- Xmo [~Cosmo@future-is.orange.co.uk] has quit [Read error: Connection reset by peer]
13:42 < Lucrece> I got 4...I'm guessing with that max pop you have 5 :)
13:42 < Ayeloria> nope
13:42 < Ayeloria> 4
13:42 < Lucrece> hmmm...2 Ds?
13:43 < Ayeloria> just 1
13:43 < Ayeloria> P and K

13:44 < Ayeloria> hello again!
13:44 < Xmo> stupid phone
13:44 < Ayeloria> How many planets do you have Xmo?
13:44 < Xmo> bad reception...
13:45 < Ayeloria> no good
13:45 < Xmo> 5
13:45 < Ayeloria> Ahhh...that's fast!
13:45 < Ayeloria> I run out of metal! 
13:45 < Lucrece> yes, I can see how a P and a K would have a higher pop than a J and an R :)
13:45 < Ayeloria> How did you not run out of metal?
13:46 < Xmo> i cheat
13:46 < Ayeloria> Oh....that's not fair!
13:46 < Xmo> just kidding
13:46 < Ayeloria> :D
13:46 < Ayeloria> did you borrow some?
13:46 < Ayeloria> Or are you just very skilled?
13:46 < Xmo> nope
13:46 < Xmo> fairly skilled
13:46 < Ayeloria> Well...half way through 5th colony ship I'm out of metal!
13:47 < Xmo> though ive never started a round at the beginning
13:47 < Xmo> joined late on dev
13:47 < Xmo> npc on game1
13:47 < Ayeloria> so how have you got so many so fast if you didn't start at the beginning?
13:47 < Lucrece> I wish I was skilled enough to have 5 planets already...
13:47 < Ayeloria> yeah...I think those npc powers should have kicked in before you got your arse whipped!
13:48 < Ayeloria> Should have attacked Earl! She's a menace!!
13:48 < Lucrece> or just create a planet, make heaps and heaps of ships and then attack :)
13:48 < Xmo> hehe
13:48 < Xmo> thats no fun
13:49 < Ayeloria> no fun getting wiped out as soon as you start doing something either!
13:49 < Ayeloria> Captain Romaine should get those dragon IIs into gear...they've been sitting in the same place for months doing nothing...

13:49 < Ayeloria> So suicidal of you!
13:49 < Ayeloria> You could have done more damage before you died!!
13:49 < Xmo> i was basically inactive
13:49 < Ayeloria> We realised!
13:50 < Lucrece> and your homeworld is still empty :)
13:50 < Xmo> i know, iwanted to do more damage
13:50 < Ayeloria> Yeah, that would have been good...
13:50 < Xmo> c'est la vie
13:50 < Ayeloria> I mean, you could have helped us kill Lina! We had to do that on our own!
13:51 < Lucrece> can't say he'd have many planets left though! :)
13:52 < Ayeloria> nah...
13:54 < Xmo> gaah, i want my new colony ship now!
13:54 < Ayeloria> I have to wait until morning...
13:54 < Lucrece> me too...won't have it until morning.
13:54 < Xmo> mine is done in 4 hours
13:55 < Ayeloria> :P
13:55 < Lucrece> I don't like having mine done unless I know I'll be awake. Otherwise it'll sit there doing nothing.
13:55 < Xmo> yeah
13:55 < Xmo> same here
13:56 < Lucrece> 11.5 hours...than 7.something for it to colonise...I'll have another planet by 4 tomorrow afternoon :)
13:56 < Ayeloria> I slowed mine down...but it means I'll get more metal which is good!
13:57 < Lucrece> I'm still losing metal every hour.
13:57 < Ayeloria> I can't lose any more! I ran out :)
13:57 < Ayeloria> Where's an L when you need it?
13:59 < Lucrece> I still haven't found any Ls... :(
14:00 < Xmo> i only have 1
14:00 < Xmo> i want more
14:01 < Ayeloria> You are greedy! I don't even have 1 yet! All I seem to find are Rs and Js!
14:01 < Lucrece> I've found Rs, Js, Ps, a Y and Ds.
14:01 < Lucrece> oh, and a K :)
14:02 < Lucrece> I need Ls though.

15:07 < draq> What can I do with nebulas, debris fields and asteroids? :)
15:07 < draq> Kam: hi
15:07 <@Kam> nothing yet
15:07 < draq> Kam: read my comments?
15:07 <+Ayeloria> draq you mine them with remote mining
15:07 <@Kam> some of them
15:07 <+Ayeloria> Or asteroids can be used for remote research
15:07 < draq> Ayeloria: do you need to research that?
15:07 <+Ayeloria> or remote intel
15:07 <+Ayeloria> but does anyone actually do that?
15:08 <+Ayeloria> Yes you do
15:08 <@Kam> you need to research that yes
15:08 < draq> bugger
15:08 <@Kam> and mining facilities
15:08 <@Kam> you need to research everything!
15:08 <+Ayeloria> and beavers (or equivalent) to make them
15:08 < draq> Kam: can I spend my money quicker? I have loads of minerals...
15:08 <@Kam> spend it quicker then
15:08 <+Ayeloria> You can give some to me!
15:08 <@Kam> turn off mining completely
15:08 <@Kam> and just build ships
15:08 <@Kam> or buildings
15:08 <+Ayeloria> What are you building on your planets?
15:09 <@Kam> then it should go down
15:09 <+Ayeloria> you need to be colonising lots!
15:09 < draq> Good point.
15:09 < draq> How do I increase population quicker?
15:09 <@Kam> u dont
15:09 <+Ayeloria> Get planets is the only way to do it
15:09 <@Kam> well u can colonise a planet multiple times
15:09 <+Ayeloria> some planets grow faster than others too...
15:10 < draq> Can you exchange technology?
15:10 <+Ayeloria> I wouldn't colonise multiple times at this point in the game though!
15:10 <+Ayeloria> No
15:10 < draq> Ppl have planets all around me already
15:10 <@Kam> well send out probes to find planets
15:10 < draq> Be good if I could just buy things with my money
15:10 <@Kam> they are probably hiding somewhere
15:11 < draq> So minerals mined from other planets go into a pool? i.e. I don't have to move them or something?
15:11 <@Kam> well everything in voidwars is pretty much taken out over time
15:11 <@Kam> no
15:11 <+Ayeloria> no, you can use whatever you've got wherever you mine it
15:11 <@Kam> if u look at your empire report page
15:12 <+Ayeloria> How many planets do you have?
15:12 <+Ayeloria> From my calculations the "average" empire now has 5.3 planets.
15:12 < draq> How do I see my rank compared to say this cartman character?
15:12 <+Ayeloria> You don't if it's not in the report
15:13 <@Kam> just scout him with probes
15:13 <+Ayeloria> You can just compare yourself to the ones you see, but you really don't have any idea where you are unless you're in the report
15:14 <@Kam> what is your total population?
15:14 < draq> Is impulse technology a bad thing to research? it has taken like a week and still not finished :)
15:15 <@Kam> lol
15:15 < draq> Total Empire Population: 1,918,642
15:15 <+Ayeloria> You need to work out what it is you want to research and then research only those techs that lead to that...
15:15 <@Kam> i suggest researching easier stuff first
15:15 <@Kam> do you only have 1 planet?
15:15 <@Kam> or 2?
15:15 <+Ayeloria> You might want to research fighting ships or something, for example, to defend yourself a bit.
15:15 <+Ayeloria> He'd have to have more than 1
15:15 <+Ayeloria> Or he'd be 1.8 million :)
15:16 <@Kam> well i mean 1 planet other than his home planet
15:16 <+Ayeloria> Ahhh...
15:17 <+Ayeloria> I wouldn't be doing impulse technology yet, I'd find something to focus on 
15:18 < draq> 4 atm
15:18 <+Ayeloria> That's not bad
15:18 < draq> Ok, what should I research then for fighters?
15:18 <+Ayeloria> But keep working at building colony ships
15:18 <+Ayeloria> What species are you?
15:18 <+Ayeloria> They're different for the different races :)
15:19 <@Kam> if u have much resources
15:19 <@Kam> build more shipyards
15:19 <+Ayeloria> But don't build them too close to your homeplanet...they're good for refuelling as you send ships further away
15:20 < draq> I have this Friendly Ships display, but no ships show up when I click it
15:21 <+Ayeloria> refresh your screen
15:21 <+Ayeloria> sometimes you get "ghosts" of ships that aren't there anymore
15:21 <@Kam> i can colonise at my own pace now since i have fighters guarding my planets =)
15:22 < draq> Btw, how do you refresh exactly?
15:22 <+Ayeloria> that's what I need...
15:22 <+Ayeloria> F5
15:22 < draq> It asks about postdata?
15:22 <@Kam> lol
15:22 <@Kam> yes
15:22 <@Kam> click ok
15:22 < draq> ok
15:22 <+Ayeloria> I need fighting ships. I did mine II first
15:23 <@Kam> thats what im going for now
15:23 <@Kam> what race are you?
15:23 <+Ayeloria> I'm going for fighting ships now
15:23 <+Ayeloria> I am Bakani
15:23 <@Kam> im etrib
15:23 <@Kam> so i have less resource troubles than you =)
15:23 <+Ayeloria> Yeah...
15:23 <+Ayeloria> I'm struggling with metal :)
15:24 <@Kam> but bakani grow quicker than us
15:24 <+Ayeloria> But building 3 mine 2's...too bad I can't find any L class planets!
15:24 < draq> Where can I refuel? At any of my planets?
15:24 <@Kam> which is a bitch
15:24 <+Ayeloria> You refuel at planets with shipyards
15:24 <@Kam> you can refuel at any planets of yours that have shipyards
15:24 < draq> bugger
15:24 <@Kam> you can even refuel at allied planets with shipyards
15:24 <@Kam> and you can research refuelling stations
15:24 <+Ayeloria> you just need allies for that :)
15:24 < draq> This game is so hard. I mean fuel is not even a "resource"
15:24 <@Kam> and some refuelling ships
15:24 <@Kam> yes it is
15:24 <+Ayeloria> Yes it is...it's calanium
15:24 <@Kam> its the green thing
15:25 <@Kam> i wonder when fuel will become an issue
15:25 <@Kam> and we have to wait to refuel our ships 
15:25 <@Kam> since we ran out of calanium
15:25 <+Ayeloria> I'm going fighting ships...then remote mining...refuelling stations...and refuelling ships...can't quite decide on the order though!
15:25 <+Ayeloria> Get the P class planets!
15:25 <@Kam> well i think they come along the way

19:02 < Triumph> anyone here?
19:04 < Cartman_> sure
19:04 < Triumph> why does xiv/kam hate flash...
19:04 < Triumph> i dont get it =/
19:05 < Cartman_> then ask them, I'm sure they have their reasons *g*
19:06 <@Kam> because flash is a tool for 2 year olds to create dancing squirrels
19:06 < Triumph> hahahaha
19:06 < Triumph> but its used in ways beyond that tho
19:06 <@Kam> yes dancing monkeys
19:07 < Triumph> and complete websites solely on flash
19:07 <@Kam> dancing penguins
19:07 < Triumph> not that theres anythign wrong with dancing ANYTHING
19:07 < Triumph> =/
19:07 < Triumph> is it because its proprietory?
19:07 <@Kam> thats one of the reasons
19:08 < Triumph> what are others?
19:08 < Triumph> cuz it seems so great to me
19:08 <@Kam> voidwars would be a good application for flash
19:08 < Triumph> really?
19:08 <@Kam> minesweeper would be a good application of flash
19:08 <@Kam> but a website is not a good application of flash
19:08 < Triumph> why not? it carries the interactive parts of a website
19:09 < Triumph> accessiblility
19:09 < Triumph> stuff like that which you'd want in a website
19:09 < Triumph> correct?
19:09 <@Kam> well thats what xiven would tell you
19:09 <@Kam> but i shouldnt need a plugin in my browser to view a website
19:10 < Triumph> is that the main reason?
19:10 <@Kam> fine make a silly dancing cow
19:10 <@Kam> but stick it as a link and tell ppl what it is
19:10 <@Kam> so that if they want to watch a dancing cow
19:10 <@Kam> they can watch a dancing cow
19:10 < Triumph> well besides dancing cows, the only reason i can semi agree with you on is the plug in
19:10 < Triumph> but none the less, the plug in is minimal
19:11 <@Kam> http://www.camelot-europe.com
19:11 < Triumph> and it seems that flash can give you results of any of the best websites out there today
19:11 <@Kam> look at that site
19:11 < Triumph> besides the DL size
19:11 < Triumph> heard of this game
19:11 < Triumph> worth playing?
19:11 <@Kam> now if u look at that without flash installed
19:11 <@Kam> it looks terrible

19:12 < Triumph> so just get flash?
19:12 <@Kam> but why?
19:12 <@Kam> im not looking at any dancing cows
19:12 <@Kam> im looking at some text
19:12 < Triumph> because it makes alot of site more dynamic
19:12 < Triumph> but its prettier
19:12 <@Kam> i dont need a dancing cow to tell me that the servers are down
19:13  * Iso|AroundMaybe hates Flash...
19:13 <+Iso|AroundMaybe> Tho not entirely certain in what context you'e discussing it...
19:13 < Triumph> of course you dont
19:13 <@Kam> yes
19:13 <@Kam> so why have silly prancing menus
19:13 <@Kam> when u dont need them
19:13 <+Iso|AroundMaybe> you can make silly prancing menus is a much mroe elegant way in pure CSS anyway...
19:14 < Triumph> cuz its pretty
19:14 <+Iso|AroundMaybe> and keeping your site nice and accessible...
19:14 <@Kam> alot of things are pretty
19:14 < Triumph> well why dont you jsut write your entire site in plain txt then? dont make it look nice
19:14 <+Iso|AroundMaybe> Add a bit of JS and it gets prancier - and use XBL and you can do almost anythign you want with it...
19:14 <@Kam> there is making it look nice and making it dance
19:15 < Triumph> i think its the same thing, just written in a differnet way in which you need a plugin
19:15 <@Kam> yes but for a forum
19:15 <@Kam> does it need to dance?
19:15 < Triumph> but theres nothign wrong with dancing
19:15 <@Kam> for a news page
19:15 <@Kam> does it need to dance?
19:15 < Triumph> if it can why not :)
19:15 <+Iso|AroundMaybe> Personally, I have nothing per se against dancing sites. But why use flash to do it, which makes your site messy. non standard and harder to modify? Use standards to achieve the same!
19:16 <@Kam> i can jump out of the window
19:16 <@Kam> but i dont
19:16 < Triumph> jumping out the window and doing something better isnt the same thing....
19:16 <+Iso|AroundMaybe> The main advantage I see is skinnability anyway. With CSS and JS used to make a page look pretty, yu can have many different themes for a site. Including, msot importantly, the plain text one.
19:17 <@Kam> also flash assumes a visual UA
19:17 < Triumph> what makes it nonstandard? when something enw comes out, it starts out as nonstandard just like everyhting else... and its not neccessarily harder to modify
19:17 <+Iso|AroundMaybe> If you use Flash, then your site must always look the same, or you have to rewrite the whoel thing from scratch. Or maintain multiple versions for peopel who don't have visual UA's
19:17 <@Kam> its not better
19:17 <@Kam> thats your problem
19:17 <+Iso|AroundMaybe> Flash is not new!
19:17 < Triumph> JS = ?
19:18 < Triumph> UA = ?
19:18 <+Iso|AroundMaybe> Its also a proprietry format. So I def can't modify it...
19:18 <+Iso|AroundMaybe> JS = Javascript
19:18 <+Iso|AroundMaybe> UA = User Agent
19:18 < Triumph> yea, but its also not used by a small group of people
19:18 <+Iso|AroundMaybe> What do you mean?
19:18 < Triumph> well quite a few people use flash nowadays..
19:19 <+Iso|AroundMaybe> 'quite a few'? Elaborate...
19:19 < Triumph> you guys act like its some out of the way sect that uses it 
19:19 < Triumph> lots of people i know use it for different things
19:19 <+Iso|AroundMaybe> 'quite a few' people use CSS and JS and other standards to do the same for their sites...
19:19 <@Kam> alot of ppl use IE that doesnt make it great
19:19 < Triumph> rofl...
19:19 <@Kam> alot of people play the sims
19:19 <@Kam> that doesnt make it great
19:20 < Triumph> i didnt say that made it great
19:20 < Triumph> but im saying your using that as a reason to dismiss it it seems
19:20 <@Kam> if you want to make a stickman fight against other stickmen then by all means use flash
19:20 <@Kam> or you want mr nice
19:20 <+Iso|AroundMaybe> agreed. Its great for little games online. Pretty, and prob very easy to write for...
19:21 <@Kam> yeah
19:21 <+Iso|AroundMaybe> but not for makgin a website's appearence...
19:21 < Triumph> its basically a movie that you can interact with 
19:21 < Triumph> just seems more lively 
19:21 < Triumph> and interactive
19:22 < Triumph> but thats just me
19:22 <@Kam> yes but we didnt want an interative movie
19:22 <@Kam> we wanted a webpage
19:22 <+Iso|AroundMaybe> yeah - hence good for games.
19:22 <+Iso|AroundMaybe> What is the application you were discussing that I missed?
19:22 < Triumph> well wouldnt an interactive movie type make for a fun webpage?
19:22 < Triumph> something that conveys the message and makes it interesting
19:22 < Triumph> flash
19:23 <+Iso|AroundMaybe> yeah, but ni what context? Where do you want to use it and Kam not?
19:23 < Triumph> im jsut saying in general
19:23 < Triumph> im using it in some of my sites
19:23 <+Iso|AroundMaybe> ok, then Flash has certain applications. But not, IMO, on websites...
19:23 < Triumph> dispite kam warning me that it is the devil incarnate
19:23 <@Kam> if you want a nice intro to your site that is ok aslong as it can be skipped
19:23 <@Kam> it should NOT be used for menus
19:23 <@Kam> and any links
19:23 <@Kam> and not for PROPER content
19:24 <+Iso|AroundMaybe> agreed
19:24 <@Kam> http://camelot-europe.goa.com/en/home.php
19:24 <@Kam> is a bad example of flash
19:24 <+Iso|AroundMaybe> If you use it for things liek links, your site can't be properly archived by google for a start.
19:24 <@Kam> i cant see the server status unless i have the plugin
19:24 <+Iso|AroundMaybe> and no one wants google to skip over their site!
19:24 < Triumph> if all the stuff you mentioned could be easily editted in context, what would be the problem
19:25 <@GwieF_> as a point.. can you find any site that isn't a dancing hampster or a game that benifits from being done in flash
19:25 < Triumph> ok thats a good point
19:25 <@GwieF_> because I can point out quite a few that the flash part really sucks
19:26 < Triumph> so what is this about links tho? whats wrong with links per se?
19:26 <+Iso|AroundMaybe> Links are fine - they shoudl be in HTML tho...
19:26 <+Iso|AroundMaybe> not in some flash widget thingy menu system.
19:26 < Triumph> oh
19:27 < Triumph> but if the button itself is flash, but the entire button being a like
19:27 < Triumph> *link
19:27 < Triumph> thats diffferent?
19:27 <@Kam> lol
19:27 <@Kam> thats attrocious
19:27 <+Iso|AroundMaybe> why would you want to do that?!?!
19:27 < Triumph> because you can put action to mouse over, just as if you did in CSS
19:27 < Triumph> stuff like that
19:27 <+Iso|AroundMaybe> well then, here's a suggestion, use CSS...!
19:28 <@Kam> do you want a dancing button?
19:28 < Triumph> yea basically
19:28 -!- m4xx^bla [gugu@pD902C20B.dip.t-dialin.net] has joined #voidwars
19:28 <@Kam> can we turn off the dancing button?
19:29 < Triumph> not to mention if i knew how to make a site with CSS and knew mysql/php or how to install phpnuke sites, i'd sure as hell use that
19:29 < Triumph> but flash seems so much simpler than that as of now
19:29 <@Kam> thats exactly why so many people use it badly
19:30 <@Kam> if you going to do something do it properly
19:30 <+Iso|AroundMaybe> just learn! Its not hard...
19:30 < Triumph> i mean mysql/php sites are for all practical puposes, automation and update

19:30 < Triumph> just learn... right
19:30 < Triumph> its not like theres some proper way to learn that stuff
19:31 <+Iso|AroundMaybe> ...?
19:31 < Triumph> every time i read some article that tries to explain it it makes little sense to me
19:31 <@Kam> is there a proper way to learn flash?
19:31 < Triumph> like hmtl
19:31 < Triumph> i got in no time
19:31 < Triumph> CSS, i got the hang of it
19:31 < Triumph> but mysql is nothing like those two
19:31 < Triumph> yea... there is actually
19:31 <@Kam> well of course it isnt
19:31 < Triumph> theres lessons IN the program
19:31 <@Kam> its sql
19:31 <+Iso|AroundMaybe> then whats your problem? Actually, can you show me one of these sites that 'needs' flash?
19:32 < Triumph> i know, i even understand the concept but I cant understand anything beyond that
19:32 <+Iso|AroundMaybe> and anyway, sql is server-side, flash is client side so if you're tryign to replace one witht he other, I can see where you';re struggling...
19:32 <@Xiven> ooh, exciting discussionary going on
19:32 <@Kam> select name FROM ships WHERE speed > 10
19:32 < Triumph> i didnt say it needed flash, i agreed with gwief that most flash sites can be done nicely in CSS, but its just an extra
19:32 <@Kam> i fail to see how u can not understand it!
19:32 < Triumph> ...
19:32 <+Iso|AroundMaybe> can you show me one of your sites that uses it tho...?
19:33 -!- Iso|AroundMaybe is now known as IsoSchiz
19:33 < Triumph> http://www.endless-waltz.com/vicky/home.html
19:33 < Triumph> its just something i slapped together
19:33 < Triumph> its not close to done, i jsut put some pics together
19:33 < Triumph> the only thing i semi worked on was the flash...
19:34  * Kam waits for ie to recover after trying to load that page
19:34 < Triumph> hahaha
19:34 <@Kam> wellit loads in mozilla fine
19:34 <+IsoSchiz> erm.. I fail to see any flash on it tho!
19:34 <@Kam> aside from the large white gaps without plugins
19:35 <+IsoSchiz> doh
19:35 < Triumph> cuz its all CSS other than those flash links
19:35 <+IsoSchiz> was lookgin at the wrong page.. that was weird...
19:35 <@Kam> but i cant use the page in mozilla
19:36 < Triumph> i got another quick question, why in CSS cant you select a portion in IE, you select everything from the bottom of the page up
19:36 <@Xiven> because IE6 has a huge bug
19:36 <+IsoSchiz> cos IE sucks?
19:36 <@Xiven> it's fine in IE5 strangely
19:36 < Triumph> so its and IE bug
19:36  * IsoSchiz only uses IE 5
19:36 < Triumph> lol
19:36 < Triumph> i see
19:36 < Triumph> thats just plain retarded
19:36 <+IsoSchiz> I've not seen a single case in which IE 6 was better than 5.5. And SOOO many where it;s worse!
19:37 <@Xiven> well it handles the box model "correctly"
19:37 <@Xiven> that's about it
19:37 <@Kam> anyway if i turn off images in my browser the website still needs to be usable
19:37 <@Xiven> ie. width includes padding and border
19:37 <@Kam> so if i turn off "flash" can i still use your site?
19:38 <+IsoSchiz> ok, that was its one advantage..
19:38 < Triumph> nope
19:38 <@GwieF_> that site killed my IE
19:38 < Triumph> haha
19:38 <@Kam> yes it kills it for a while
19:38 <@GwieF_> and I havn't got flash installing mozilla
19:38 <@GwieF_> installed even
19:38 <+IsoSchiz> hmm.. IE certainly doesn't like it does it!
19:39 <+IsoSchiz> is it gonna come back?
19:39 <@Kam> so people get distracted by the dancing stars and dont follow any of the links
19:39 < Triumph> whats so bad with that ? :)
19:39 <+IsoSchiz> erm, the links don't work for me..
19:39 <@Kam> if you visit a site 100 times
19:39 <+IsoSchiz> is that to be expected...?
19:39 < Triumph> yea
19:39 <@Kam> you soon get very pissed with dancing starts
19:39 <@Kam> stars
19:39 < Triumph> i didnt write script for the links yet
19:40 <+IsoSchiz> 'script for links'
19:40 < Triumph> why would you get pissed at stars
19:40 <+IsoSchiz> <a href='about.html>About</a>
19:40 < Triumph> it just makes you an angry man
19:40 -!- m4xx^bla is now known as m4xx
19:40 <+IsoSchiz> hmmmm.. that was hard...
19:40 <@Kam> if you see anything dancing 100 times over and over
19:40 <+IsoSchiz> (insert missing ' obviously)
19:40 < Triumph> well that essentially all you have to do 
19:40 <@Kam> i mean if google had a flash plugin on the main page
19:40 <@Kam> it would drive you insane
19:40 <@Kam> if it had a dancing logo
19:41 < Triumph> hmmm thats kinda true
19:41 <+IsoSchiz> Thing is Triumph, the flash on that site is superfluous, makes the site less accessible, and doesnt' actually gain you anything you coudln't have doen in JS anyway...
19:41 <@Kam> you usually use flash when you lack enough content so want to distract the users with silly animations
19:42 < Triumph> the only thing that makes it less accessible is the fact that you have to DL the flash plugin, but it seems all of you guys already have it anyways... the people who complain about how evil flash is..
19:42 <@Kam> no that isnt
19:42 <@Kam> its still less accessible with the flash plugin
19:43 < Triumph> well true, if there was more content I'd be more concerned about the content, but the fact is that content comes down to cntl+c cntl+v
19:43 < Triumph> hows it less accessible?
19:44 <+IsoSchiz> cos without flash, I cant see any words for those links.
19:44 <+IsoSchiz> or the links
19:44 <+IsoSchiz> or anythign to do with them actually...
19:44 <@GwieF_> the user has no control they can't open the links in new tabs etc, search engines will not index those links etc
19:44 <@Kam> and things are harder to read if things are dancing
19:45 <+IsoSchiz> what if I was trying to read this site from my bed (which is conveniently close, but not that clsoe to my computer)? I normally zoom text to many, many times base size to do this.. I cant zoom the flash tho...
19:45 <@Kam> well u can
19:45 <+IsoSchiz> can I?
19:45 <@Kam> but that makes it go horribly wrong
19:45 < Triumph> no, the text is in the button, not on top of it
19:45 <@Kam> u can zoom each individual flash
19:46 <+IsoSchiz> Yeah, i count that as not beign able to zoom the site.
19:46 <+IsoSchiz> thats jsut broken zoom
19:46 <@Kam> which is a very useful feature
19:46 <+IsoSchiz> erm... I'd ratehr it increased the size of the whoel element tho
19:46 <+IsoSchiz> so that you coudl still see it all...
19:46 <+IsoSchiz> just zoomed

19:47 <+IsoSchiz> argh! mysql would be of no help to you ehre!
19:47 <+IsoSchiz> Its a database!
19:47 < Triumph> i mean the whole site
19:47 < Triumph> not th ebutton itself
19:47 <@Kam> well u dont need mysql to do a website
19:47 <+IsoSchiz> That wold have zero, zilch, no effect on whether you used flash or not
19:47 <@Kam> mysql is for database driven stuff
19:47 < Triumph> well i was going to give it a blog
19:48 <+IsoSchiz> fine
19:48 < Triumph> as you can see by "journal"
19:48 <+IsoSchiz> but that is independant of the flash button problem!

19:49 < scubaz0r> how big do mysql DB get on a frequently used forum?
19:49 < draq> BIGGER X10 ANYTHING YOU SAY LOSER
19:49 <@Xiven> you get linux working on this p133 machine of mine and i'll use it
19:49 < Cosmo_> at least my girlfriend has managable hair
19:49 <@Xiven> it runs windows 98 fine
19:49 <@Kam> that depends on whats in the forum
19:49 <@Xiven> but will not cope with any form of linux
19:50 <@Kam> however much space the text in the forum takes up
19:50 < draq> Xiven: show me XP on a P133 and we'll talk :)
19:50 <@Xiven> no seriously
19:50 < scubaz0r> well lets say .... 1000 posts, short posts along with avatar pictures
19:50 <@Xiven> i just want a minimal linux build to work on this thing
19:50 <@Xiven> but everything tries to initialise X and then fails dismally
19:50 < draq> Xiven: but a 133 is sort of crap?
19:50 < scubaz0r> rofl good call
19:50 <@Xiven> i just want a fecking gateway machine
19:51 <@Xiven> i don't want to do anything amazing on it
19:51 <+IsoSchiz> it should work fine, surely
19:51 < draq> Xiven: then why X?
19:51 < scubaz0r> ewww gateway...
19:51 -!- m4xx [gugu@pD902C20B.dip.t-dialin.net] has quit [Signed off]
19:51 <+IsoSchiz> just dont run X, yeah
19:51 <@Xiven> draq: because all the linux distros seem to insist on it
19:51 < draq> Xiven: checkout smootwall.org
19:51 <+IsoSchiz> not Gateway, gateway!
19:51 <@Xiven> smoothwall won't install
19:51 < draq> Xiven: why?
19:51 < scubaz0r> gateway is one step off of AOL
19:51 <@Xiven> similar symptoms, screen goes plain black like when mandrake (f.e) tries to start x
19:52 <@Kam> lol
19:52 <+IsoSchiz> install Debian...
19:52 <@Kam> scubaz0r you are on another planet
19:52 <@Xiven> i don't have debian
19:52 <@Kam> not Gateway 
19:52 <@Kam> a gateway
19:52 <@Xiven> i have slackware, mandrake and smoothwall
19:52 <+IsoSchiz> you ahve a cd burner?
19:52 <@Xiven> i do
19:52 < draq> Xiven: I can send you a CD?
19:52 <@Xiven> but i don't have a decent net connection
19:52 < scubaz0r> oh.. 
19:52 < scubaz0r> lol i see
19:52 <+IsoSchiz> Burn the first cd iso from the web and install it from there...
19:53 <+IsoSchiz> ok, buy a copy. It costs almost nothing. Just the postage.
19:53 <@Xiven> well also, this machine currently has no network card/modem and won't until i confirm that it is actually capable of running a decent OS
19:53 <+IsoSchiz> It can runit. A friend of mine's P90 has run debian before...
19:54 <+IsoSchiz> with X actually...
19:54 < draq> Xiven: my advice is do not waste your time with old hard ware...
19:54 <@Xiven> i think the main issue is lack of memory
19:54 <+IsoSchiz> Tho it took an age to install :-)
19:54 <+IsoSchiz> How much mem you got?
19:54 <@Xiven> draq: unless you want to GIVE me a better machine STFU
19:54 < scubaz0r> why would you want to run linux on something with no network hardware anyways....?
19:54 <@Xiven> like I SAID
19:54 < draq> Xiven: I mail stuff for free at work. So give me a mail address and I could send you Debian for e.g.
19:54 <@Xiven> if i get linux to install on it i will put a net card in it
19:54 <@Xiven> but otherwise it's not worth it
19:54 < draq> Xiven: Buy a 2nd hand Xbox? :P
19:55 <@Xiven> draq: I have NO monet
19:55 <@Xiven> money
19:55 <@Xiven> i got this thing for free
19:55 < scubaz0r> !topic Voidwars is now a flea market
19:55 < draq> Xiven: no money sucks :/
19:55 < scubaz0r> hey not a bad comp for free
19:55 <@Xiven> anyway where was I
19:56 <@Xiven> yes, 16 MB RAM
19:56 <+IsoSchiz> oh
19:56 <+IsoSchiz> I see
19:56 <+IsoSchiz> ah
19:56 <+IsoSchiz> well
19:56 <+IsoSchiz> erm
19:56 <@Xiven> :)
19:56 <+IsoSchiz> scrap it!
19:56 <@Xiven> hehe
19:56 <+IsoSchiz> :-)
19:56 <@Xiven> seriously, I mean it SHOULD be capable of running smoothwall
19:56 <@Xiven> if it can run windows 98
19:57 <+IsoSchiz> I still think you could get it running a basic debian install with no X... BUT, I'm nto sure it'd be worth it. It might slow down your conenction if its acting as your gateway

21:45 < Uhyre> i'm almost to the 'falcon'
21:46 < Cosmo_> got any metal?
21:46 < Uhyre> yes
21:46 < Uhyre> i need polomite
21:46 < Uhyre> like 9,000 tons
21:46 < Cosmo_> lol, for what?
21:46 < Uhyre> research lvl2
21:46 < Cosmo_> 1 research II facility costs 9k polomite?
21:47 < Uhyre> it cost 10k 10k 9k
21:47 < Cosmo_> sweet mother
21:47 < Cosmo_> thats more than we'll have for a while
21:47 < Uhyre> it is 20k polo in dev game
21:47 < Uhyre> be glad they lowered it
21:47 <@Kam> well some of the costs may not be perfect
21:47 < Uhyre> i'm colonizing a y so i can get a head start
21:47 < Cosmo_> 9k polomite is huuuuuge
21:47 < Cosmo_> yeah, i've got a Y
21:48 < Uhyre> umm, just imagine 3, 4 and dare i say it 5!
21:48 < Cosmo_> wow, so you have crystal, metal, research and fighters eh?  nice
21:48 < Uhyre> i have alot of calanium too
21:48 < Uhyre> when it's useless
21:48 < Uhyre> i wish i had this much at the start of last game
21:48 <@Kam> it wont be when u have large fleets
21:48 < Cosmo_> so apart from polomite...you're set to rock
21:49 < Uhyre> yes
21:49 < Cosmo_> 10 planets yet?
21:49 < Uhyre> only 5
21:49 < Uhyre> one that gives me each mineral
21:49 < Cosmo_> nice...not a bad idea
21:49 < Uhyre> but i took a  stupid C aswell
21:50 < Cosmo_> lol
21:50 < Uhyre> to keep it from Zaratul
21:50 < Cosmo_> well i have 3 J's :)
21:50 < Uhyre> is that how you got to the top 5
21:50 < Cosmo_> i had a J next to me, which was the first thing i took
21:50 < Cosmo_> hence i was leader
21:50 < Uhyre> ah
21:50 < Cosmo_> but my J's are great for research
21:50 < Uhyre> how much does it cost to fill up a ship?
21:51 < Cosmo_> depends on the ship
21:51 < Uhyre> a probe for example
21:51 < Cosmo_> if it's empty, 160 i guess
21:51 < Cosmo_> thats the fuel tank capacity
21:51 <@Kam> well fuel is a new thing atm
21:51 < Uhyre> i wonder if there is an SUV effect on the capitol class ships
21:51 <@Kam> so we would rather u have too much than too little
21:52 < Cosmo_> thats the thing with fuel, it should be abundant...because it is.  the problem is refuelling
21:52 <@Kam> so do u think that 9k polomite is way too much for a level 2 building?
21:52 < Uhyre> maybe you could tie how much fuel is to a certain stock of something, or to fuel at your local petrol station
21:53 < Uhyre> YES!
21:53 < Cosmo_> well if you want to keep everyone at research level 1 for a while, no
21:53 < Uhyre> it will take several days to make that much
21:53 < Cosmo_> but it's a lot of polomite...and it should take way more than a few days for most people to get 9k
21:53 < Cosmo_> it would take me about 14 days right now
21:53 < Uhyre> the etrib will be easier to get there
21:53 <@Kam> well it would take me an infinite amount of time atm
21:54 < Uhyre> but your planet grows
21:54 < Uhyre> and you can build a lvl 2 mine sometime in 2 weeks
21:54 < Uhyre> more planets need it, just like with the Rs last game
21:54 < Cosmo_> you got mine II's?
21:55 < Uhyre> no, i went for research 2 w/o realizing there cost
21:55 < Cosmo_> well...now i know :)
21:55 < Uhyre> it wouldn't be hard
21:55 < Uhyre> i still need fusion reactors
21:56 < Uhyre> which would take about 6 hours
21:56 <@Kam> ok well im adjusting the costs of a few buildings since their polomite cost is relatively still high 
21:57 <@Kam> since it was based on the old polomites rareness some of the costs are still a little too high
21:57 < Cosmo_> what's your research income?
21:57 < Uhyre> about 6,000 if i research 100%
21:57 < Uhyre> but i am building a viper
21:57 < Cosmo_> so about 2500?
21:58 < Cosmo_> 3500 rather

21:58 < m4xx> hiho
21:58 < Uhyre> lo
21:58 < Cartman_> hi ^^
21:58 < Uhyre> the ship yards are way too low
21:58 < Cosmo_> Asshole, you killed one of my probes ;)
21:58 < Uhyre> i could almost build one now
21:58 < Cosmo_> shipyards are just right i think
21:58 <@Kam> i have a 2nd now
21:58 < Cosmo_> it's painful for most people still, and you need them to expand
21:58 <@Kam> so needed for my fighters to get anywhere
21:59  * Cosmo_ = Reno
21:59 < m4xx> hmhm if you could build them faster you would say they are to expensive ^^
21:59 < Cosmo_> bad m4xx
21:59 < m4xx> oh ^^
21:59 < Uhyre> refuelling shoud be a different buiolding
21:59 < m4xx> i'm sorry
21:59 < Cartman_> yeah, sure m4xx :)
21:59 < Cosmo_> thats ok...im sure you'll burn in hell for your crimes
21:59 < m4xx> i didn't want to kill it i only wanted to say hello..
21:59 < Cartman_> hrhr
21:59 < Uhyre> lol
22:00 < Cosmo_> well dont kill anymore, or i'll have to glare at my monitor :)
22:00 < Uhyre> hehe, i'm the only one here at teh top of a chart
22:00 < Uhyre> except for m4xx
22:00 < Uhyre> but he will fall
22:00 < m4xx> i'm very happy to have so many fans ^^
22:00 < Uhyre> yeah!
22:00 < Uhyre> it's lower!
22:01 < Cosmo_> well im second population, my ship is getting experience and im knocking out 4k permanent research and it's on the up bigtime :)
22:02 < Cosmo_> i shoulda said "fleet" ... would have been more scary
22:02 < m4xx> ^^
22:02 < Aviarium> well, lets take a look how long you can stay on top there uhyre
22:02 < Uhyre> hopefully in the next 5 hours i can come up with 1,000 polomite
22:02 < Cosmo_> 1k now?  dammit, you're gonna be the research king it would seem
22:02 < Uhyre> then i will kill
22:02 < Uhyre> 1,200
22:03 < Uhyre> i built an institue
22:03 < Uhyre> and a lvl 1 research
22:03 < Aviarium> well, you are at 6k research? got 8k on max ^^
22:04 < Uhyre> are you the building people
22:04 < Uhyre> that build fast
22:04 < Aviarium> uhm, dont think so ^^
22:04 < Uhyre> it takes me awhile to build stuff
22:04 < Uhyre> but i have contruction lvl2
22:04 < Aviarium> who not? =)
22:05 < m4xx> hey avi, my ship is more experienced than yours ;-)
22:07 < Aviarium> gnagnagna
22:07 <@Kam> what you want to research is advanced metal refining
22:07 < m4xx> why you choose the nick "aviarium"? is aquarium already in use? ^^
22:08 < Aviarium> well, better named after a real word, than like some sort of... code
22:08 < Cosmo_> how much crystal do you think 1000 metal is worth at auction?
22:08 < Uhyre> 4
22:08 < Uhyre> i have plenty of metal now
22:09 < Uhyre> i just had to mine from my homeplanet overnight
22:09 < Aviarium> and how many planets do you have?
22:09 < Uhyre> i'm not saying
22:09 < Uhyre> twice
22:09 < Cartman_> he has 5 planets
22:09 < Cartman_> :P
22:09 < Aviarium> lol
22:10 < Uhyre> i'll have 6 in a couple of hiours
22:10 < Cosmo_> cheap metal going on the auction site :)
22:10 < Cartman_> "cheap" :)
22:10 <@GwieF> hmm I have 10 planets... but I'm behind on .. pretty much everything
22:11 < m4xx> ll cheap ;-)
22:11 < m4xx> i hope that's a joke reno :>
22:12 <@Kam> i want my class D to get to max pop
22:13 < Uhyre> i wnat my soon-to-be Y to max out
22:13 <@GwieF> I want my 4 class D to get to max pop :p
22:13 < Cartman_> ich want my 3 class D to max pop ;)
22:13 < Cartman_> hm
22:13 < Cartman_> -ch
22:16 < Uhyre>  are anyof you near zaratul by any chance?
22:17 < Uhyre> i see another terran probe but don't know who it is
22:18 < Uhyre> does red mean no fuel left?
22:18 < Uhyre> or very little
22:18 < m4xx> ya
22:18 < m4xx> not enough to move 1 sector
22:19 < Uhyre> so it will make the red arrow or will stop before the red arrow
22:19 < Cartman_> stop
22:19 < Uhyre> damn
22:19 < m4xx> :]
22:19 < Cartman_> and move damn slowly
22:19 < Cartman_> ;)
22:19 < Uhyre> i can't quite make it to the probes and back to my homeworld
22:20 < Uhyre> why couldn't i have bought a more fuel effienct probe!
22:20 < Aviarium> research it ;)
22:20 < Uhyre> i'll try it anyways
22:20 < Cartman_> or design one with a bigger tank :D
22:20 < Uhyre> it takes forever to research tacheon sensors
22:21 < Aviarium> then you do something wrong ^^
22:21 < m4xx> fill in some tequila :]
22:21 < Uhyre> i'm thinking of MKIII
22:21 < Aviarium> just started the research facility mk2 building ^^
22:21 < Uhyre> i just started to build it a while ago
22:21 < Uhyre> i don;t have enough polomite thoug
22:22 < Uhyre> wait!
22:22 < Uhyre> loans!
22:22 < Aviarium> hehe
22:22 < Aviarium> i have enough ^^
22:22 < Uhyre> 2.5k
22:22 < Uhyre> i bet you didn't have the 9k originally
22:22 < Aviarium> not really, but can build two of them now ^^
22:22 < Uhyre> so, i think you should pay tribute to me somehow bye buying my auction
22:22 < Cartman_> hmm
22:23 < Uhyre> because you wouldn't have been able to build 1 if it weren;t for me
22:23 < Uhyre> :)
22:23 < Aviarium> no thx ^^
22:23 < Cartman_> hehe
22:23 < Uhyre> i know you need fuel, you have so many freakin ships
22:23 < m4xx> lol
22:24 < Aviarium> and 12k fuel -_-
22:24 < Uhyre> it's only 10k
22:24 < Aviarium> and what do i do with 22k??
22:25 < Uhyre> make even more ships
22:25 < Uhyre> you need to be at the top of some chart don't you
22:25 < Aviarium> well, really dont need fuel ^^
22:25 < Uhyre> if no one bids i'll have 22k
22:26 < Uhyre> i make 700 an hour

16:40 < Uhyre> are the mining researchs worth the time???
16:40 < Meduza> being skinny has nothing to do with the amount of blood produced and circulating in your body.  your health does and liver-pancreas-marrow function
16:40 < draq> How do I know if my low metal amount is stopping building or delaying me?
16:41 < Uhyre> well, most of us don't seem to have very healthy livers
16:41 < Meduza> well if its in teh red and you have low metal reserves it would be slowing you down. if you have none you would be stopped
16:41 < Uhyre> drag- it will be the resource that is at 0 and is being used on the empire reprt
16:42 < Uhyre> it just pauses as it slowly gets a little metal as you mine it
16:43 < Meduza> I have a pretty health life.  its not hard to achieve, 
16:47 < Uhyre> you have really good timing Vorlon

21:11 < Uhyre> it gets really long after about 25-27 depending on what you went down, tech, or ship oriented
21:12 < Uhyre> ie, you went for a ship, or you just skipped them and went on to more techs
21:13 < Aviarium> you think so?
21:18 < Uhyre> most likely
21:18 < Uhyre> do you know how to make half circles

21:30 < Uhyre> no one bought my

21:31 < Uhyre> economy is in ruins
21:31 < Uhyre> civil war is soon to come
21:32 < Cosmo_> got your research II yet?
21:37 < Uhyre> yes
21:37 < Uhyre> i had it last night
21:40 < Uhyre> i am even starting to make my own polomite
21:41 < Uhyre> and in 3 hours when i get home, i will have mine2 intel2 and that silly refuelling ship
21:41 < Uhyre> there still needs to be a larger version of the support ship
21:41 < Cosmo_> still 5 planets?
21:41 < Uhyre> 6
21:41 < Cosmo_> not bad.  worried people will get your planets?
21:42 < Uhyre> that's why i built a elmilio this morning
21:42 < Uhyre> elmikia
21:43 < Uhyre> i am getting it confused with emglio
21:43 < Uhyre> i have started holding 2 more Js
21:43 < Cosmo_> aha.  i'll be happy when i have nice crystal income.  im cool with everything else so far.  I have 2 big K's but they're recent
21:43 < Uhyre> have you gotten to the crystal refining
21:43 < Cosmo_> nope
21:43 < Uhyre> ah
21:44 < Uhyre> i am wondering if it is worth the time
21:44 < Cosmo_> we can refine stuff? :)
21:44 < Uhyre> yes
21:44 < Cosmo_> what initial branch is it on?
21:44 < Uhyre> it says "gives a passive bonus to **** production"\"
21:44 < Cosmo_> ahh i see it
21:44 < Uhyre> plasma drillion
21:45 < Cosmo_> i might go for that, it wouldnt take too long
21:45 < Uhyre> it would take me about 8-9 hours to reserach either meteal or crystal
21:45 < Cosmo_> i could do with a percentage increase in my metal and crystal
21:46 < Cosmo_> with how much research per hour?
21:46 < Uhyre> 10k
21:46 < Cosmo_> jesus...10k.  does that include your home planet?
21:46 < Uhyre> yes
21:47 < Uhyre> that is how much my homeplaet gives me
21:47 < Cosmo_> just home planet???
21:47 < Uhyre> yes
21:47 < Uhyre> why?
21:47 < Cosmo_> research II is nice then..
21:47 < Cosmo_> i gotta get me some of that
21:48 < Uhyre> it has my ruri thing too
21:48 < Cosmo_> i get 10k currently if i include my home planet.  no ruri thing yet
21:48 <@GwieF> nooooooo
21:48 < Uhyre> click on yor homeplanet
21:48 < Uhyre> what is the or main reserahch

11:54 < draq> What should I research to get Mine Mk2?
11:54 < Lucrece> laser drilling
11:55 < Meduza> use your tech tree. click on something like plasma drilling and see if mine 2 comes up and then click that 
11:55 < Meduza> laser/plasma same diff ;)
11:55 < Lucrece> or you could do that too :)
11:55 < Lucrece> apart from the fact that you need laser to get plasma *grins*
11:56 < Meduza> oh i must have laser already .. ooohhh 
11:56 < Meduza> i should log in more than twice a dya me thinks 
11:56 < Lucrece> might be a good plan!
11:57 < draq> I have laser drilling. It asks for Fusion Reactor. Better question: How do I get Fusion Reactor?
11:58 < Lucrece> in the tech tree, have you clicked on fusion reactor to see what's required for it, or does it come up blank?
11:58 < Meduza> have you clicked on fusion reactor?
11:58 < Meduza> jinx luc
11:58 < Lucrece> :)
11:59 < Meduza> tech tree aint that hard to use. I worked it out all by myself when I started 
11:59 < Lucrece> it's kinda hard to know what you need for fusion reactor though...the first thing needed doesn't have a similar name at all :)
12:00 < draq> Yes, what is the dis-similar name then please?
12:00 < Lucrece> microfission reactor.
12:00 < Lucrece> and you'll need something after that, too, but clicking on fusion reactor will tell you that one.
12:00 < Lucrece> once you have MR anyway :)
12:00 < Meduza> fission.fusion hmmmm I suppose it is an advancement 
12:01 < Meduza> you can always work backwards in teh tree. I dont see why people have so much trouble 
12:01 < Amazon_> You can only work backwards so far
12:01 < Amazon_> Then you hit blanks
12:01 < Amazon_> If you don't have enough of the prerequisites

13:07 < Xmo> it costs a fair bit here
13:07 < Lucrece> I think it'd be possible to use it from a Palm. It is to use msn anyway.
13:07 < Xmo> yup
13:07 < Lucrece> you can build refuelling stations anywhere can't you?
13:07 < Xmo> i guess so
13:08 < Xmo> you got the tech?
13:08 < Lucrece> cool.
13:08 < Lucrece> yep
13:08 < Xmo> they cost lots?
13:08 < Meduza> Im nearly there. 
13:08 < Lucrece> I didn't want to try to build it and find out it had to be on an asteroid or something like that.
13:09 < Lucrece> not really, actually. 4k metal, 4k crystal, 10000 cal.
13:09 < Lucrece> well, the cal is a bit of a killer, but if you're mining enough, it's worth it!
13:10 < Meduza> I might try to get some remote mning under my belt first.  
13:10 < Meduza> After I squish so and so ;) heheheheh 
13:10 < Lucrece> I'm close to remote mining...
13:10 < Lucrece> I just really really really hope they don't cost the same as what they did in game 1!
13:11 < Meduza> I have only one etch and the remote mining tech to get :) yeah :)  gonna get me some vipers first 
13:12 < Lucrece> I'm researching plasma drilling now, then I can get remote mining. I think I researched a lot smarter this game than the first.
13:12 < Lucrece> For some reason, last game I was determined to be able to form an alliance, so I did that first. Was stoopid of me.
13:12 < Meduza> thats the last one I need too. 
13:13 < Meduza> same here.  
13:14 < Lucrece> but now, I can get refuelling stations, can nearly get remote mining, can get 2 types of fighting ships, the equiv. of beavers and mine II.
13:14 < Xmo> im being quite clever so far too. going nicely
13:15 < Meduza> wooo thats good. :)  Im muat stillbe a bit behind you. 
13:15 < Lucrece> oh, and the research institute and spatial scans. Even though they don't work :(
13:15 -!- Amazon_ [~Amazon@dial81-131-213-86.in-addr.btopenworld.com] has quit [Quit]
13:16 < Xmo> spatial scans dont work?
13:16 < Meduza> I did research into spatial scans :( and they arent working 
13:16 < Xmo> i have them
13:16 < Meduza> ours wont work 
13:16 < Lucrece> have you tried them, Xmo? We both get database errors.
13:17 < Lucrece> but you don't lose the intel points, which is a bonus! :)
13:17 < Meduza> basically that would mean its stufffed!
13:18 < Xmo> i havent tried. requires too much intel
13:18 < Meduza> whats 1000 pts?? nothing 
13:18 < Lucrece> it's a lot if you haven't got many points! :)
13:19 < Xmo> its lots to me
13:19 < Meduza> as I said 5% from eth start of teh game is only 15minutes of research or build time 
13:20 < Lucrece> how on earth did Uhyre get so much research so fast??
13:21 < Xmo> his home planet does 10k alone
13:21 < Meduza> couple of Js and research level 2?
13:22 < Xmo> he got 1 good planet of each resource. then didnt expand more
13:22 < Lucrece> yeah, that'd do it I guess!
13:23 < Lucrece> I'm only getting 2680 an hour.
13:23 < Lucrece> also losing lots of metal again!
13:23 < Xmo> i get 7k research
13:23 < Meduza> wow! 
13:24 < Lucrece> I want that much!
13:25 < Lucrece> no wonder you're in the top 5 :)
13:25 < Xmo> heh
13:25 < Xmo> its soon to be much more
13:26 < Lucrece> I'd be getting more if D's grew faster!
13:26 < Xmo> ive got 2 2.4d's now
13:26 < Xmo> i want them full
13:27 < Lucrece> I've got a 2.4 and a 2.2. There's a 2.3 near me, but it's only one sector away from my hp so I'm getting other planets first.
13:27 < Xmo> yeah
13:28 < Meduza> thats fantastic I had to go to thelimits of a stork to get the only D near me 
13:29 < Lucrece> I still need an L though! *grins*
13:29 < Xmo> i had to go a long way for my second d.
13:29 < Xmo> ive got 2 L's now
13:30 < Lucrece> bastard! gimmee!
13:30 < Meduza> I would have jad anotehr L if my storkie was murdered 
13:30 < Xmo> heh
13:30 < Lucrece> who murdered your storkie??
13:32 < Lucrece> but once the scans start working, and I build some refuelling stations, I might be able to find one that's uncolonised! :)
13:33 < Xmo> good luck. not too many planets left
13:33 < Lucrece> I know! :(
13:33 < Lucrece> or I could just finish remote mining...
13:35 < Xmo> could be too late by then
13:35 < Lucrece> there're 810 planets total, yeah? There are still nearly 300 uncolonised!

14:27 < BlackGlass> Kam, I'd just like to say, I have enjoyed voidwars very much, and I reckon you guys the development team do a preatty smack up gosh darn good job.
14:28 <@Kam> why thank you

14:28 <@Kam> i dont suppose you are a multi-milionaire?
14:29 < BlackGlass> no, only a lowly wage earner... and I can code for free, but that still doesn't help you realy...   how much you need?
14:30 <@Kam> about 3.2 million
14:30 < Meduza> why that much? 
14:31 < BlackGlass> Hmmmm, is that in a currency other than US$ AU$ Pounds sterling or Yen?    I could infact probably come up with 3.2 million quite easily in Indonesian currency for instance.
14:31 < Meduza> hell in AU that would be ablut 9.6 mill
14:31 <@Kam> 3.2 million pounds would be nice

20:57 < Astat> me, sai oh, dita
20:57 < Astat> damn missile frigates... they seem to do nothing
20:57 < Gul_Uhyre> you should have chimeras instead
20:57 < Astat> i do
20:57 < Astat> they dont do much as well - and the plasma corvettes are gone
20:58 < Astat> killed by fighter, who should have been taken out long ago by 3 missile frigates :)
20:58 < Gul_Uhyre> if it is still going to 2 days let me know :)
20:58 < Gul_Uhyre> I'll end it the
20:58 < Gul_Uhyre> n

21:01 < Aviarium> hmm, who is programming the Planetary Report Page at the moment?
21:01 <@Xiven> planetary report page i was working on
21:01 <@Xiven> why?
21:01 < Cosmo_> missile frigates suck ass
21:01 < Aviarium> there is a bug
21:01 <@Xiven> and what is that?
21:01 < Aviarium> the quantum planetary shields does /5 and not /2 as shown on the page
21:01 <@Xiven> yes
21:01 <@Xiven> good
21:01 <@Xiven> deal with it
21:01 <@Xiven> i'll fix it later
21:01 < Cosmo_> hehe
21:01 < Aviarium> hehe, ok =)
21:02 < Aviarium> anyway.. other question, is the dmg divided /5 or is just /5 part subtrated from the dmg?
21:02 < Astat> thought it was an bakani advantage
21:03 < Cosmo_> the first one Avi
21:03 < Gul_Uhyre> my homeplanet is shown as 2 when it isn't, HE"S NOT DONE FIXIIN IT
21:03 < Aviarium> veery good =)
21:03 < Aviarium> he just said that he fix this later
21:03 <@Xiven> shipyard has priority
21:03 <@Xiven> ok, anyone here using IE5?
21:04 <@Xiven> anyone at all?
21:04 < Aviarium> changed to mozilla only for this game ^^ .o0(and dont like that mousewheel isnt working with it)
21:05 < Astat> ^^
21:05 <@Xiven> well hopefully one day it'll be fixed, which is more than we can say for the bugs in IE which will never be fixed
21:05 < Astat> you changed in the end? hehe :P
21:05 < Aviarium> say that it is microsofts fault ;)
21:05 <@Xiven> well it is
21:06 <@Xiven> IE doesn't conform to half the standards it claims to
21:06 <@Xiven> has many well-known gaping bugs
21:06 <@Xiven> and is never going to be fixed
21:06 <@Xiven> therefore the entire web is held back
21:06 < Aviarium> have you ever thought of taking an open source browser and change it to be best used for voidwars? =)
21:07 < DaCartman> mozilla is open source
21:07 <@Xiven> the only problem with mozilla/firebird is the mousewheel bug
21:07 <@Xiven> if you want to fix it feel free
21:07 <@Xiven> mozilla is indeed open source
21:07 <@Xiven> anyway, the shipyard has been changed back to the old way of working thanks to numerous bugs
21:08 <@Xiven> so should be working in IE5 again
21:09 < Aviarium> uhm, what was the difference? ^^
21:09 <@Xiven> it showed them with category headings
21:10 < Aviarium> ah :) yes, now i remember, that was not showed in IE as i started ^^
21:20 <@Xiven> ok shields should be shown right now
