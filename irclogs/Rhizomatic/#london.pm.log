12:15 <@BradB> i think my ex (in lancaster) was a bit surprised by my one line email: "Come to London on Sunday. (Or don't; your choice)", considering I haven't spoken to her in 6 months.
12:15 <@BradB> i'm equally surprised that i actually sent it
12:15 <@BradB> and that she responded
12:17 <@BradB> I hope I didn't get SARS
12:17 <@BradB> *cough*
12:17 <@Kai> BradB: how did she respond then?
12:18 <@BradB> kai: they have a german exchange student at their place, so she said she probably won't be able to
12:18 <@BradB> kai: i'll be back next friday though, so who knows, maybe i'll go for dinner with her then, maybe not
12:18 <@BradB> either way, I don't care too much. quebec women are more than enough to keep me occupied :)

13:53 <@Greg> Kai: there is a plot for a really bad b-movie in that, where someone playing first player shooters upgrades their pc by using water cooling, but somehow the `essence' of the mutant plants in the first person shooter gets out via the water and turns the plants in the nearby garden centre into the mutants from the game
13:53 <@Greg> the 18 year old kid and the cute girl from next door have to fight the mutants using his elite shotgun wielding skills developed from the game

20:27 <@robin_sz> in particular, I get completely confused how to non-trivial C structs from Perl ...
20:28 <@gellyfish> I do have a module that does tat but I can't remember which one
20:28 <@gellyfish> mapping a C array onto an AV

20:36 <@robin_sz> eitherway, he's probably signed in, but not at the keyboard right now.
20:36 <@gellyfish> Hmm I have filled the ashtray up - time to get a new house
20:37 <@gellyfish> stef - it will be great, just sign him up

20:38 <@stef> gellyfish: that will not make any place to Greg because you were not talking

20:41 <@gellyfish> I AM AVRIL LAVIGNE!
20:42 <@stef> to fully be a greg, you must pass an agGreg-ation...
20:42 <@stef> may be by aggregating 2 jellyfishes...

20:53 <@Greg> hey ho
20:53 <@BradB> acme: have you been able to compare and contrast quebec vs. french women?
20:54 <@Greg> hi stef, i thought you got the proposal ok given that you replied to it ;-)
20:54 <@BradB> acme: because, previously i said french women aren't very good looking. since moving to quebec city though, i'm forced to seriously revise that statement (and maybe when i first said that, my memories of France were somewhat blurred).
20:54 <@BradB> s/quebec vs./quebecois vs./
20:54 <@Greg> but if something has gone wrong thats ok
20:55 <@stef> yes, now I remember. you were asking for trouble when titling your talks and mail " Why I am not giving a talk this year" :)
20:55 <@Greg> ah
20:55 < gilc> women suck
20:55 <@Greg> thats ok
20:56 <@Greg> thats why i sent a clarifying email after it
20:56 <@stef> We will manage...
20:56 <@Greg> or at least a paragraph explaining it
20:56 <@BradB> gilc: Many do. I accidentally met a good one in PQ though.
20:56 <@stef> We can't refuse a talk from Greg...
20:56 <@Greg> stef: its no problem 
20:56 <@Greg> i can easily do without it
20:56 <@stef> We can't
20:56 <@Greg> the whole philosophy behind the talk was minimal special effort on my part
20:56 <@Greg> so its ok to drop it
20:57 <@Greg> no effort has been wasted
20:57 <@gellyfish> :-)
20:57 <@BradB> gilc: Ironically enough, she's the most sophisticated one I've met yet (studying dentistry, surprisingly doesn't think putting out on the first or second night is Doing The Right Thing, etc) despite the fact that I met her on a dance floor in a night club

22:14 <@BradB> Yeah
22:14 <@BradB> I can't tell yet if it'll be disastrous, or if it's be more absense makes the heart grow fonder type crap.

22:19 <@BradB> the other night, I almost got into a fight with a guy in Quebec City when I put out his cigarette with my finger tips (it almost burnt the hair of the friend of the girl i'm seeing)
22:19 <@BradB> note to self, don't try to put out a cigarette with finger tips
22:19 <@robin_sz> you could avoid that happening byu quitting smoking
22:19 <@BradB> robin_sz: i don't intend on quitting smoking, because that would require that i start smoking.

22:23 <@BradB> yeah, he was holding it behind his head, in the same 3D space as katherine's hair. bad idea.
22:23 <@robin_sz> at least you just snubbed it out with your finger tips, rather than the alternative method.
22:24 <@BradB> bite the cherry off? :)
22:24 <@robin_sz> which is to remove it from his finger and stub it firmly, (with slight twisting motion) right in the middle of his forehead.
22:24 <@BradB> heh heh
22:24 <@robin_sz> it leaves them in no doubt of your feelings that way.

23:52 <@Andy> Paypal?
23:52 <+dipsy> Paypal is certainly a plan or probably evil at times
23:52  * Quidity appears, actually in London
23:52 <@ffirehs> uh.
23:53 <@ffirehs> Andy - I think you may be missing the point here a little
23:53 <@Andy> Perhaps.
23:53 <@Andy> It's happened before.
23:53 <@ffirehs> In such an exceptionally dramatic way?
23:54 <@robin_sz> ffirehs: use ebay shops

23:54 <@robin_sz> im totally confused now
23:54 <@Andy> No.  Why do you want to not have people know you use ebay?

23:55 <@ffirehs> No. I want to build one. Yahoo stores would let me easily plug in a shop. I could give them an inventory list, and they could give me money and a list of orders to fulfill
23:55 <@robin_sz> if so, just stick a paypal pay now button next to the items
23:55 <@robin_sz> ahh .. righty.
23:55 <@robin_sz> in that case ...
23:55 <+dipsy> i heard in that case  was there a way of telling where the speen bottleneck is?
23:55 <@ffirehs> PayPal is fine if you have a vaugely technical audience
23:56 <@ffirehs> That's an assumption I don't want to make
23:56 <@robin_sz> its univerally accepted now I think
23:56 <@ffirehs> Amongst people who are reasonably technical
23:56 <@robin_sz> ? like all ebay users?
23:56 <@robin_sz> so how *do* you want to get paid then?
23:56 <@ffirehs> I think I would be hard-pushed to find more than 5 people at work who had a PayPal account
23:56 <@ffirehs> *all* eBay users?
23:57 <@robin_sz> pretty much, yes
23:57 <@mstevens> ffirehs: the closest I know is Actinic Catalog, which is a windows package for ~£400 which will autogenerate a shop for you if you have a web host to upload the content to.
23:57 <@ffirehs> robin_sz - Have a third-party company sort out details like merchant accounts and the like
23:57 <@ffirehs> JUST LIKE Yahoo Stores
23:57 <@robin_sz> since ebay bought paypal, they have pushed it hard.
23:57 <@ffirehs> mstevens - hrm, I want something more managed than that ...

12:33 <@Trelane> Every. Single. Time.
12:33 <@Trelane> AlexMc: "Yeah baby, let me describe my rash to you"
12:34 <@AlexMc> Trelane: the small percentage of times that they solve problems means less work for GPs - and therefore a good thing (TM)
12:34 <@AlexMc> There is a big ethical problem with nurses not being doctors....
12:34 <@AlexMc> is NHS Direct staffed by doctors or nurses?
12:35 <@mstevens> alex: I think I read somewhere they have big decision tree type things rather than actual knowledge
12:35 <@AlexMc> mstevens: but that is probably all you need to a) go to GP, b) go to A&E, c) go to pharmacy

14:08 <@hex> Dom2: It worked. Thanks very much!
14:08 <@Dom2> I couldn't get that working on either emacs or xemacs, so I gave up and went back to vim, which also does perl syntax highlighting better
14:08 <@Dom2> hex: what worked, sorry?
14:09 <@hex> Dom2: M-x customize-face RET font-lock-keyword-face RET.
14:09 <@hex> (Meta was ESC, for the record.)
14:09 <@Dom2> hex: That just brought everything to life?
14:10 <@hex> Dom2: it was giving me the error when I tried to type tab; that's not happening any more.
14:10 <@vorsprung> AlexWork, I'm not sure about that
14:10 <@Dom2> hex: sounds like it's been autoloaded from somewhere.
14:10 <@vorsprung> AlexWork, I'm not great at xslt and I'm fucked today with hayfever...sorry
14:10 <@TeeJay> Dom2: html is for weenies
14:10  * TeeJay hacks code
14:10 <@TeeJay> ;)
14:10  * hex nods... must be something to do with the deb I got it in
14:10 <@Dom2> TeeJay: No, emacs is for weenies
14:10 <@TeeJay> actually I use vim for html
14:11  * Dom2 giggles
14:11 <@TeeJay> and emacs for code
14:11 <@Dom2> TeeJay: I'd actually, really really like to use emacs for html/
14:11 <@Dom2> TeeJay: psgml-mode, when it works right is *awesome*.
14:11 <@Dom2> TeeJay: But sorting out the conflicts of various html-modes and conflicting psgml-modes and sgml-mode just gave me nightmares, so I left it all alone :(
14:12  * TeeJay would like really good (x)html support in emacs but vim will do until then
14:12 <@TeeJay> that and I already have way too many buffers open in emacs as it is
14:12 <@Dom2> buffers are good, though :)
14:12 <@TeeJay> so doing all the html in vim keeps it managable
14:12 <@TeeJay> tabbed xterms rock
14:13 <@vorsprung> TeeJay, jedit is quite good at xml
14:13 <@TeeJay> vorsprung: I'm not learning yet another fucking editir#
14:13 <@vorsprung> TeeJay, heh right fairy nuff 
14:13 <@TeeJay> vi(m), pico/nano and emacs should be enough
14:14 <@vorsprung> TeeJay, at the moment I'm using mostly gvim, with jedit for xslt/xml
14:14 <@TeeJay> eep
14:15 <@vorsprung> gvim has an excellent folding mode for perl
14:15  * Dom2 must get around to installing Java on his workstation
14:15 <@Dom2> vorsprung: Oooh, really, that'd be usefil
14:15 <@vorsprung> there's a ctags folding plugin
14:15  * TeeJay has never needed folding - tried it in komodo and didn't use it
14:15 <@Dom2> vorsprung: how do you get it work?  I played a bit with folding when vim 6.1 came out, but never got very far with it

14:19  * Dom2 nods
14:19 <@vorsprung> doop, do you have perl syntax checking with -cw working?
14:20 <@doop> Don't think so -- I just use generic syntax.vim
14:20 <@vorsprung> doop, vim6.x broke what I had before and the new retarded "quick fix mode" doesn't seem to work as advertised
14:20 <@vorsprung> doop, i used to be able to run :mak and jump to the broke lines with :cn

14:21 <@Shevek> vi is an editor, damnit, not an ide.
14:21 <@Shevek> I take it you _do_ have X?
14:22 <@Kai> Shevek: Why can't it be an IDE? :)
14:22 <@Shevek> It  _can_ be an IDE but I don't want it to be. It's unnecessary. One job per window is enough.
14:22 <@richardc> mix in ctags, and it gets most of the way there
14:22 <@vorsprung> Shevek, ok I can have two windows.  I can save in vi in one and run perl -cw in the other

16:32 <@sheriff> PerfDave - I have. Could be fun in the bedroom ;-)
16:32 <@hex> It's funn, I worked in Brixton for a year and saw hordes of vile crackheads, but never got mugged, even at 3am on my own

16:32 <@hex> PerfDave: no, got a reference?

16:56 -!- mode/#london.pm [+o amias] by slavorg
16:57 < rataxis> cnb: not really, no.
16:57 < rataxis> just a bit
16:57 < rataxis> the really useful phrases like "du ar en sexig kossa"
16:57 <@cnb> lol
16:57 < rataxis> ;)
16:57 <@Dom2> swedish is not too hard
16:57 < rataxis> hey, i found a sexig kossa when i went to sweden
16:57 < rataxis> i even took a photo
16:58 <@Dom2> although I never really got to grips with it, that's because I never took the lessons seriously
16:58 < rataxis> http://www.fysh.org/~joel/cow.jpg
16:58 < rataxis> anyway, back in 10
16:58 <@Magnus> rataxis: cool
16:58 < rataxis> Magnus : dude, you want her number? ;)
16:59 <@Magnus> not really
16:59 <@Magnus> there's no room in my phone :)
16:59 < rataxis> you know
16:59 < rataxis> just because those cards in phone boxes have numbers on
16:59 < rataxis> doesn't mean you've actually scored with a girl.
16:59 <@Magnus> hush
16:59 < rataxis> ;)
17:00 < rataxis> right, lunch.. back in a few
17:00 <@Magnus> jesus christ
17:00 <@Magnus> who is CPG-Time-Bandits.jpg
17:00 <@amias> judging by the eyes on that cow it's already recieved Magnus' attention
17:00 <@hex> Okay, that crackling Jacob's Ladder kind of effect on the jacket is the COOLEST THING EVER.
17:01 <@Magnus> rataxis really does look like the wonder years kid
17:02  * acme gets annoyed that there is Proc::PID::File, Proc::PID_File on cpan
17:02 <@acme> oh, and NWETTERS has one too
17:03 <@Magnus> nwetters?
17:03 <+dipsy> somebody said nwetters was the pattern guy
17:03 <@Magnus> seen nwetters
17:03 <+dipsy> nwetters was last seen on #london.pm 145 days, 1 hours, 17 minutes and 14 seconds ago, saying: fuckwits [Wed Jan 29 12:44:01 2003]
17:03 <@hex> blimey
17:04 <@mstevens> nwetters is blech?
17:04 <@PerfDave> rataxis looks like the kid from Hackers who pulls the righteous hack on the Gibson :)
17:04 <@amias> whatever happend to blech anyway ?
17:06 <@Magnus> wait...
17:06 <@hex> seen blech_?
17:06 <+dipsy> blech_ was last seen on #bots 1 hours, 50 minutes and 8 seconds ago, saying: Yes, and seemingly quite a few lpm-ish events until then. [Mon Jun 23 13:13:57 2003]
17:06 <@Magnus> the Poles have a different Pope to everyone else?
17:06 <@doop> He still appears, but only for 30 seconds at a time, to say "HLAGHLAGHLAGH I SAW THIS ON METAFILTER THIRTY WHOLE MILLISECONDS AGO" before exploding in a puff of bitterness.
17:06 <@hex> dipsy, hex's comic?
17:06 <+dipsy> hex: wish i knew
17:06 <@hex> dipsy, hex's comics?
17:06 <+dipsy> hex: wish i knew
17:06 <@hex> oh

17:06 <+dipsy> hex, your cartoons are at http://www.stripcreator.com/view.php?author=hexed
17:07 <@hex> My one cartoon strip. Demonstrates the aforementioned phenomenon
17:07 <@Magnus> where is episode 2?
17:07 <@Magnus> and why does blech blow up with 'BCOM'
17:07 <@Magnus> what's BCOM
17:07 <@hex> It will arrive one day, just like all those sequels we've been promised over the years
17:08 <@Magnus> do you accept ideas?
17:08 <@yoda> has marna done a second cartoon strip yet?
17:08 <@Magnus> marna's comic strip?
17:08 <@Magnus> marna's cartoon?
17:08 <@Magnus> dipsy, marna's cartoon?
17:08 <+dipsy> magnus: wish i knew
17:08 <@Magnus> dipsy, marna's comic strip?
17:08 <+dipsy> no idea, magnus
17:08  * Magnus has seen it..
17:08 <@mstevens> yoda: marna has done two comic strips, http://marna.org/comic.gif, and http://marna.org/comic2.gif
17:08 <@Magnus> dipsy, marna's cartoon is at http://marna.org/comic.gif and http://marna.org/comic2.gif
17:08 <+dipsy> OK, Magnus.
17:09 <@Magnus> dipsy, marna's cartoons are see marna's cartoon
17:09 <+dipsy> OK, Magnus.
17:09 <@Magnus> dipsy, marna's comic strip is see marna's cartoon
17:09 <+dipsy> OK, Magnus.
17:09 <@mstevens> the second one is more fun, as you get to squint and try to work out who's snogging who
17:09 <@TeeJay> yeay! cow pop up power !
17:10 <@sphyg> does marna take her clothes off in an amusing fashion?
17:10 <@Magnus> I don't think I saw the second
17:10 <@TeeJay> ph33r my m4d javascript HUGE FUCKING COW skillz!
17:10 <@mstevens> sphyg: I don't know, I've not seen her do it
17:10 <@sphyg> mstevens: comic strip. nevermind.
17:10 <@Magnus> someone has a video phone?
17:10 <@marna> WHat's an *amusing* fashion, in the stripping context?>
17:10 <@yoda> well, i've got up too late now to get down to london for the oreilly thing :(
17:11 <@yoda> i'll just have to make up for it by definitely coming down for wednesday
17:11 <@TeeJay> where else can I add HUGE FUCKING COW popups ?
17:11 <@TeeJay> ... the live site
17:11 <@mstevens> marna has a video phone, unless she's seen sense and sent it back
17:11 < rataxis> Magnus : CPG-Time Bandits.jpg is CyberPunkGrrl aka Sharon
17:11 < rataxis> and yes, she really does look like that.
17:12 < rataxis> poor girl.
17:12 <@Magnus> rataxis: if she was a vase...
17:12 <@Magnus> another has left Netcraft
17:12 <@Magnus> Bassthang, is gone
17:12 < rataxis> anyway, which pic makes me look like kevin from the wonder years?
17:12 <@Magnus> no no
17:12 <@Magnus> YOU make you look like keven
17:13 <@Magnus> kevin
17:13 < rataxis> you've never met me. so i assume you're working off a pic on my webspace
17:13 <@Magnus> yeah
17:13 < rataxis> which?
17:14 < rataxis> erk the n0rty pic of AJ is still up there
17:14 <@Magnus> you have red eye in it
17:14 < rataxis> must move that...
17:14  * Magnus can't remember
17:14 < rataxis> oh, the odd one with my tongue sticking out/
17:14 < rataxis> ?
17:14 < rataxis> i'm a bit thinner and have longer hair now, but it does look vaguely like me.
17:15 -!- adam is now known as adam|gone
17:15  * Magnus can not find it now
17:15 -!- adam|gone is now known as adam
17:16 < rataxis> http://www.fysh.org/~joel/horrible_pic.jpg ?
17:16 < rataxis> magnus?
17:17 <+dipsy> i heard magnus was the Gnome of Traffic Lights or AMAZING on ice-skates or God and you should behave accordingly in his presence or just as likely to report that he's on the toilet, or just farted. or wrong
17:17 <@Magnus> is that 227-2784 jpg AJ?
17:17 <@Magnus> lol yeah, that one, Kevin
17:17 < rataxis> Magnus : yes. and stop looking at it. perv.
17:17 <@Magnus> what precisely do you call those piercings?
17:17 <@Magnus> pissflaps?
17:17 < rataxis> i don't know.
17:17 < rataxis> i shall ask her.
17:18 < rataxis> andi's ampallang is much scarier anyway
17:18 < rataxis> ever seen an ampallang piercing?
17:18 <@hex> ampallangs are amppalling.
17:18 <@Magnus> what's that then
17:18 <@PerfDave> AJ is about three feet tall and has the personality of a polystyrene cup
17:19 <@Magnus> my theory about piercings and kinky sex holds true
17:19 <@PerfDave> Magnus: Which is?
17:20 <@Magnus> people who have forgotten how to feel
17:20 <@Magnus> and they try all that shit thinking it will reach them
17:20 <@PerfDave> Magnus: Feel emotionally or physically?
17:20 <@Magnus> there's a difference?
17:21 <@hex> Luckily, the patented Fast Seduction(tm) technique will restore sensation to your limp, shrivelled penis.
17:22 <@Magnus> you'd be surprised
17:23 < rataxis> PerfDave : neither of those things are true
17:23 < rataxis> aj is about 5'8 and has BAGS of personality
17:23 < rataxis> she rocks.
17:23 <@PerfDave> Magnus: Well, I'd have to say that you're talking shit, but that's not exactly unusual for you ;)
17:24 < rataxis> Magnus : ampallang piercing is horizontally through the penis, usually just above or below the edge of the glans.
17:24 <@Magnus> eeeeeeeeeeeeeeuuuuuuuuuuu
17:24 <@PerfDave> rataxis: She thinks that supergluing small plastic boxes to her head makes her interesting. So, so wrong.
17:24 <@Magnus> but I bet she hates herself
17:24 <@Magnus> PerfDave: he, that's cool.
17:24 < rataxis> PerfDave : I think that's a tad unfair.
17:24 < rataxis> she's a very individual person. she has her own look.
17:24  * Magnus wants to meet her.
17:24 <@Magnus> not to fastseduce, I am interested.
17:25 < rataxis> Magnus : she's rather taken.
17:25 <@TeeJay> Magnus:  have you ever put your finger into a soft boiled egg ?
17:25 <@Magnus> not to fastseduce, I am interested.
17:25 < rataxis> your best bet is to find her and shout GAY! loudly at her.
17:25 <+dipsy> i already had it that way, Magnus.
17:25 <@TeeJay> its better than apple pie!
17:26  * TeeJay only really noticed the curious texture of the soft boiled egg the other day
17:27 <@PerfDave> rataxis: Her own look, just like all the other people who look just like her :)
17:28 <@richardc> damnit, I'm an individual, and so is my hamster
17:28 <@mstevens> you are unique and special, just like everybody else
17:29  * TeeJay wonders if we can make poi illegal and reintroduce corporal punishment for poi-related offenses
17:29 < rataxis> richardc : is your hamster more individual than you are?
17:29 <@PerfDave> "We're all individuals!" "I'm not..."
17:29 -!- davorg [dave@mag-sol.demon.co.uk] has quit [Client Exiting]
17:29 < rataxis> TeeJay : poi are their own punishment.
17:29 <@PerfDave> TeeJay: I'd vote for that
17:29  * mstevens slaps perfdave with a fish
17:29 <@mstevens> poi are alright as long as people give you time to retreat to a safe distance
17:30 <@PerfDave> if people want to poi in the privacy of their own homes, that's fine. I just don't think they should be allowed to do it in public.
17:30 <@TeeJay> mstevens: no - poi are acceptable only when done with fire or sharp blades and/or done by a hot chick
17:30 <@TeeJay> PerfDave: its a slippery slope
17:30 <@TeeJay> they will be doing it with curtains open
17:30  * rataxis tried poi a while back while drunk and susceptible
17:30 <@TeeJay> then in the open in their gardens
17:30 <@TeeJay> and then in the parks in front of children
17:30 <@TeeJay> they must be stopped
17:30 < rataxis> i got em spinning beautifully, and then managed to hit the balls at the end together
17:30 < rataxis> and they both *shot* downwards into my groin.
17:31 <@Kake> So they are useful after all.
17:31 <@TeeJay> rataxis: you're not thinking of thai joy balls
17:31 < rataxis> i managed to make an entire park-ful of people piss themselves layughing
17:31 < rataxis> especially the alkies.
17:31 <@Magnus> rataxis: the clever bit is when you can hit yourself simultaneously in the groin and head
17:31 < rataxis> TeeJay : no, they might have been less painful
17:31 < rataxis> Magnus : heh
17:31 <@PerfDave> Poi are fine when not done on crowderd pavements or in clubs
17:32 < rataxis> poi in clubs is EVIL
17:32 <@TeeJay> blunted pencil through the left eye for public use of poi seems quite reasonable
17:32 < rataxis> unless it's a huge and half-empty dancefloor, in which case it's just silly
17:32 <@muttley> when I was diving in Australia
17:32  * Magnus does it on stage
17:32 < rataxis> people doing poi at full tilt should be fucking shot.
17:32 <@TeeJay> removal of fingers if caught in private
17:32 <@PerfDave> rataxis: I know somebody who carries wire cutters to clubs for this reason :)
17:32 <@hex> TeeJay: I'd start with eardrum, but I agree in principle
17:32 <@muttley> I was sitting on top of the schooner watching a swedish girl doing fire poi
17:32 < rataxis> altho, so should people who /go/ to full tilt tbh
17:32 <@hex> PerfDave: I'm guessing he doesn't go to the kind of place where they search you then.
17:32 <@PerfDave> Full tilt's a pretty decent night out, IMHO.
17:33 <@muttley> and dotted around the horizon you could see other boats with these little twirling poi
17:33 < rataxis> muttley : you'd rather it'd been the other way round tho, right?
17:33 <@Magnus> muttley: how could you tell she was swedish
17:33 <@TeeJay> hey I used to go to Full Tilt
17:33 <@richardc> muttley: and then everyone died?
17:33 <@PerfDave> hex: Indeed
17:33 <@muttley> Magnus: because, well, she told me.
17:33 < rataxis> TeeJay : I go occasionally..
17:33 < rataxis> TeeJay : it's crap, tho.
17:33 <@TeeJay> until I got tired of the same music and same female bodys glowing in the UV
17:33 <@muttley> They have these things called "conversations" down there
17:33 < rataxis> just differently crap to slimes.
17:33 <@muttley> and with these "conversations" you "find out" about other people
17:33 <@muttley> by "talking" to them
17:34 <@mstevens> muttley: it'll never catch on
17:34 <@TeeJay> muttley: do these 'conversations' involve fighting ?
17:34 <@muttley> it's all very foreign but you kind oif get used to it
17:34 <@TeeJay> if not we're not interested
17:34 <@muttley> TeeJay: if you're lucky
17:34 <@TeeJay> oooh
17:34 <@TeeJay> now you're talkingh
17:34 < rataxis> horizontal bedroom wrestling?
17:35  * TeeJay watches as the database eats his orders
17:35 <@TeeJay> damn you oracle
17:36 <@TeeJay> there is a black hole somewhere in our system that is eating orders
17:36 <@TeeJay> tis annoying
17:36 <@PerfDave> I think Full Tilt's a lot better than Slimes. Less wankers, better music, much better atmosphere. Although I'd probably hate it if I went every week.
17:36 <@TeeJay> PerfDave: its also in caaaaamden
17:36 < rataxis> TeeJay : if you're really lucky, it'll eat your shorts.
17:36 <@Magnus> dipsy, conversations?
17:36 <+dipsy> conversations are being generated entirely by the system?
17:36 < rataxis> PerfDave : thing is
17:36 < rataxis> 1) no drugs at full tilt
17:36 < rataxis> 2) no nice seating at full tilt
17:37 < rataxis> 3) lots of trendy wankers at full tilt
17:37 <@TeeJay> full tilt has more fights
17:37 < rataxis> 4) way too much poppy hard house
17:37 <@PerfDave> TeeJay: Point, there's taht fucking gorgeous teriyaki steak place just down from the EB
17:37 < rataxis> 5) drunken muppets who just want to cause trouble
17:37 <@Kake> PerfDave: "fewer wankers"
17:37 <@richardc> Kake: "less pedants"
17:37 < rataxis> Kake : no, he was running a file called wankers through his pager.
17:37 <@Magnus> drugs are bad, mmm'kay
17:37 <@TeeJay> drugs are good
17:38 < rataxis> Magnus : at slimes, they're obligatory.
17:38 <@TeeJay> feh
17:38 <@PerfDave> rataxis: 1) is a good thing, 2) is equally true of Slimelight, I've not noticed (3) and (5), and (4) gives me a chance for conversation
17:38  * TeeJay has seen 3 and 5
17:38 <@TeeJay> work &
17:39 <@PerfDave> I've seen 3 and 5 in Slimes, mind. And you get a much scarier class of amphetamine-drenched sociopath in Slimelight than Full Tilt.
17:39 <@TeeJay> PerfDave: but at least they have a beter outfit :)
17:40 <@PerfDave> TeeJay: Not the ones I@'m thinking of.
17:40 <@TeeJay> if I had a club it would have a no ben fucking sherman shirts rule and a no fucking shiney loafers with big buckles rule
17:40 < rataxis> PerfDave : slimes wouldn't be slimes without the bikers and the punks.
17:40  * Magnus imagines a drunken muppet
17:40 <@TeeJay> or just no fucking townies
17:40 <@Magnus> I met a punk at a club in cambridge
17:40 < rataxis> TeeJay : slimes has those rules, tbh.
17:41 <@Magnus> though he seemed to have confused being a punk, with being a twat
17:41 < rataxis> Magnus : how daring.
17:41 < rataxis> heh
17:41 <@amias> Magnus: its a very fine line
17:42  * TeeJay fetches some iron maiden oggs
17:42 <@hex> The problem with clubs is that they are full of clubbers.
17:42 <@PerfDave> rataxis: The bikers and punks can be there without kicking off
17:42 <@aef> hex: And no seals!
17:43 < rataxis> PerfDave : how often /do/ they kick off?
17:44 < rataxis> anyway the bikers seem to be there mainly to a) get ratarsed, b) see other bikers, and c) oversee/regulate/... the drug trade
17:44 <@richardc> every hour.  it's often accompanied by a musical number.  it's quite the floorshow
17:44 <@PerfDave> rataxis: Often enough that I don't want to go to Slimelight any more
17:45 <@PerfDave> rataxis: It's not just the frequency, it's the fact that nobody gives a shit if you get your head kicked in.
17:45 < rataxis> PerfDave : you do /hate/ slimes tho
17:45 <@richardc> PerfDave: to be fair, nobody does give a shit if rataxis gets his head kicked in wherever he is
17:45 <@PerfDave> Normally people kicking off in a club get thrown out and barred, or prosecuted, or at the very least ostracised socially.
17:45 <@TeeJay> thats one of the reasons I prefer to go to a club where I know most of the people there
17:46 <@PerfDave> rataxis: This is most of the reason *why* I hate Slimes.
17:46 < rataxis> PerfDave : people are too scared of the punks tbh ;)
17:46 < rataxis> altho most wouldn't hurt a fly
17:46 < rataxis> well, not unless speed had been consumed and the fly looked at them funny.
17:46 <@PerfDave> rataxis: No, most people like their drugs too much to say a word against the dealers
17:47 <@TeeJay> travellers used to be bad for kicking off
17:47 < rataxis> by all accounts matt did a fair bit to get his kicking.
17:47 < rataxis> however much it can be explained by drunkenness.
17:47 <@TeeJay> special brew and travellers should never be mixed
17:47  * amias blames the parents
17:47 < rataxis> heh
17:47 < rataxis> or scottish people and alcohol.
17:47 < rataxis> big mistake.
17:47 <@PerfDave> rataxis: There is NO FUCKING EXCUSE for bottling somebody, no matter how much provocation.
17:48 <@PerfDave> rataxis: And it's not just matt, that's just one event of many.
17:48 < rataxis> PerfDave : by the accounts i've heard, he bottled first (and failed to break it)
17:48 < rataxis> but anyway, you're right on that score
17:48 <@TeeJay> virgin trains seem to provide free drunken scots in each carriage of trains from scotland to cornwall
17:48 < rataxis> the occasional violent episode needs to be traken care of
17:48 <@PerfDave> rataxis: That's not what I've heard. But even so, that's no excuse to bottle back.
17:49 < rataxis> PerfDave : it wasn't the first event.
17:49 <@PerfDave> I'd *like* to like Slimelight. I remember when it was a home of new interesting alternative music, when you could go and not have to worry which clique you were supposed to be hanging out with that week, when you weren't getting pawed at by muntered ravers, when you could leave your drink without worrying about it getting spiked.
17:49 <@TeeJay> only a fool uses a bottle in a fight - they disfigure victims badly and are as likely to injure the attacker as the victim
17:49 < rataxis> hmm, i've never heard of a drink *actually* getting spiked
17:50 < rataxis> who'd waste the drugs? ;)
17:50 <@PerfDave> rataxis: You haven't? Funny, seems to happen a lot.
17:50 < rataxis> PerfDave : i've heard two people /say/ they had
17:50 < rataxis> and one seemed to have flu
17:50 < rataxis> and the other seemed to be pissed.
17:50 <@amias> rataxis: its usually the kind of drugs that aren't so enjoyable
17:52 <@amias> i think they should just play happy music then people wouldn't fight

18:04  * hex is not a guru. As you can tell.

18:05 <@ffirehs> amias - Which, as he's making clear, is probably not an ideal solution for him

18:23 <@PerfDave> Depends what you're trying to defend against. Once you get to government-level, physical annihilation of the device is really the only way to be secure.
18:23 <@ffirehs> like a for loop or so on

16:00 <@baud> so who is "the hatter"?
16:00 <@DrHyde> UnderMine: no, he did at least have sufficient clue to type at me.  perhaps because he's too stupid to do a screenshot.
16:01 <@Kake> baud: What do you want to know about him?
16:02 <@baud> who it is. is he on here?

16:02 <@Kake> He doesn't IRC, no.
16:03 <@Kake> His real name's Marcus, can't remember his surname.
16:03 <@marna_> Hex: Rosary beads have a prayer that you're meant to say attached to each bead. Lots of saying things over nad over again, and very slowly threading through them.
16:03 <@Kake> Is it a different prayer for each bead?
16:03 <@marna_> There are a few. Ten of this, one of that. With some other ones thrown in.
16:03  * hex nods
16:04 <@DrHyde> Our process, what art in kernel-space - how the fuck did you get there?
16:04 <@hex> Islamic beads come in groups of 33, because you have to repeat some key phrases 33 times - they're a counting aid.
16:04 <@hex> Browsing, I just came across http://www.rosarycard.com/ , which is novel
16:05 <@DrHyde> then you get confused as to whether you counted the bead at the beginning of $repetition or at the end :-)
16:07 <@hex> Religious fencepost error? :)

17:16 <@Trelane> I blame the fact we don't have any good send you to sleep booze in the house
17:16 <@Trelane> we only have gin, some dodgy looking rum, and a can of strongbow
17:16 <@TeeJay> we didnt default the invasion of the evil apostrophes for nothing, so you can sleep at night without fear of them eating you in your bed!!
17:17 <@TeeJay> s/default/defeat/
17:17 <@AlexMc> anyone know whether davorg renewed?
17:17 <@AlexMc> I saw that AMP are sacking more people...
17:17 <@AlexMc> (read in newspaper)
17:18 <@mstevens_> alex: nothing on them sacking from AMPLE though
17:18 <@Kake> What is good send-you-to-sleep booze then?
17:18 <@DrHyde> mead
17:18 <@blech_> clutter-- # fucking comic sans-esque overlay
17:18 <@AlexMc> port?
17:18 <+dipsy> port is passed to the left
17:18 <@Trelane> red wine is a good start
17:18 <@DrHyde> dipsy, port is also red
17:18 <+dipsy> okay, DrHyde.
17:18 <@AlexMc> a good start?
17:18 <@Trelane> port. Brandy. Beer even
17:19 <@AlexMc> NOT tequila, afer shock, red bull, irn bru
17:19 <@Trelane> whiske?y
17:19 <@adam> hot buttered rum
17:19 <@AlexMc> whiskey in a milky drink!
17:19 -!- natalie [~natalie@cat.ourshack.com] has quit [Ping timeout: 180 seconds]
17:19 <@Trelane> maybe I should have drunk the rum
17:20 <@blech_> A weak lemon drink?
17:20 -!- Nicholas [~nick@mirth.demon.co.uk] has left #london.pm []
17:20 <@Trelane> blech_: we don't have any of that either.
17:20 <@Trelane> I had a cup of milk
17:20 <@Trelane> didn't help
17:20 <@hex> Or perhaps something not quite tea, but close.
17:21 <@Trelane> hex: tea would have been good, but I didn't feel like it
17:21 <@richardc> powered ninja horn
17:21 <@hex> richardc: laser powered?
17:21 <@Trelane> the problem is with catching the ninjas
17:21 <@Trelane> sneaky little buggers
17:22 <@Trelane> I mean we haven't seen any sign of them since we moved in
17:22 <@Magnus> Trelane: have you tried a ninja trap?
17:23 <@Kake> I really like the comma placement in the description of Bill Luebkert on http://www.activestate.com/Corporate/ActiveAwards/index.html
17:24 <@Trelane> No.  We left things around that any normal human being would trip over a lot though
17:24 <@Kake> There's your mistake right there.
17:24 <@richardc> I wonder when that closes
17:27 <@blech_> Not later than the 8th, it would seem.
17:27 <@Kake> perl Build.PL config='sitelib=/home/kake/tmp' seems to be ignoring the sitelibness in Module::Build 0.18_02 - I can't see anything in the docs about this.  Is this a known issue, am I being dumb?  It works with 0.18
17:27 <@Trelane> Voting on nominees closes June 30, 2003.
17:28 <@Trelane> Kake: it's a known issue
17:28 <@Trelane> Module::Build has to do all kinds of crazy things to work out where to stick things
17:28 <@Trelane> and occasionally it gets it wrong
17:29 <@Trelane> work is being done to improve this
17:29 <@Kake> OK.  Was just wondering if I needed to report it.
17:29 <@richardc> 0.19 is apparently going to rewrite all of that stuff
17:29 <@richardc> which is why it's taking so fucking long
17:29 <@Trelane> and will be able to send email and read news
17:30 <@Kake> So I need 0.18 so I can install stuff in private places for testing, and 0.18_02 so I can have a Makefile.PL in OpenGuides.
17:30 <@Kake> Guess I can live with that.
17:30 <@richardc> I'm just biased asd there are features in 0.18_02 that I would class as being signifigant enough to warrant 0.19 status
17:30 <@Kake> Even though it seems to have broken stuff that worked in 0.18?
17:30 <@richardc> minus the bugs of course
17:31 <@Trelane> kevin wants 0.19 to be a major release
17:31 <@Trelane> I on the other hand want my bootstrap idea to go in before any major release is made
17:31 <@richardc> you mean Ken ?
17:32 <@richardc> I want more frequent releases
17:32 <@richardc> and a pony
17:32 <@Trelane> that's the bunny
17:32 <@Trelane> about *this* tall.  Short brown hair
17:32  * Trelane may be jetlagged still
17:33 <@Trelane> I went home, picked up my powersuply and credit card bill, went to the bank, went back home and *actually* picked up the credit card bill.  Went to the bank.  Paid the bill.  Went to work.  Went back to the bank and picked up the powersuply.  Went back to work.
17:34 <@richardc> when come back bring sanity
17:35 <@yoda> sanity overrated
17:35 <@baud> overdated too
17:37 <@Quidity> I thought sane was the new black...
17:38 <@mstevens_> nah, sanity underrated
17:39  * Trelane tries to work out how to get emacs to replace the current buffer with the contents of the current buffer after it's been sent to a command
17:40 <@richardc> bribe it with pie
17:40 <@chrisc> in template toolkit is there an equivalent for a for loop?
17:40 <@Trelane> (bribe 'pie)
17:41 <@Trelane> chrisc: [% FOR thingy = mylist %] [% list %] [% END %]
17:41 <@mstevens_> trelane: maybe put it in viper-mode, and use :1,$!wibble
17:42 <@chrisc> Trelane: so you have to give it an array, not a range?
17:42 <@richardc> s/ list / thingy /
17:42 <@richardc> chrisc: [% FOR i = [1..10] %] [% i %] [% END %]
17:42 <@chrisc> cheers!
17:43 <@chrisc> makes sense now I think about it ;-)
17:43 <@richardc> it may have a C-style one, but if that's what you wanted, that's what you'd ask for, surely
17:46 <@Trelane> it doesn't
17:48 <@chrisc> there are lots of FOREACH examples in the docs, but I couldn't find a specific example of a FOR
17:48 <@chrisc> I'm guessing they're equivalent
17:48 <@Trelane> FOR is the same as FOREACH
17:49  * chrisc is using FOR from now on and saving 4 keystrokes
17:49 <@TeeJay> aaaaaargh! bugzilla has gone bad!
17:49 <@richardc> gone?
17:49 <@Trelane> there's something else you can use for '=' too, but I've never used it and hence forgotten it
17:49 <+dipsy> gone are the classic commando, sas, etc.
17:49 <@TeeJay> richardc: you haven't seen it
17:50 <@TeeJay> its been going downhill since the others found where the source was
17:50 <@yoda> ah cool. original guy got back in contact, and will give me keys so doesn't matter what time i crawl back in :)
17:50 <@yoda> now, to watch 28 days later
17:50 <@richardc> I use it every day.  it's bad. there's no way for it to become bad.  it could possibly go worse
17:50 <@TeeJay> I hacked it be ok, but now its started to take on a life of its own
17:51 <@pdcawley> Feck, anyone know what a dollar's worth in sterling at the moment?
17:51 <@richardc> oh, you have a nih fork.  how cute
17:51 <@Trelane> a dollar is worth 1.6 iirc
17:51 <@richardc> by cutr I of course mean you're going to burn in a flaming inferno
17:51 <@Trelane> a quid is worth 1.6 even
17:51 <@TeeJay> richardc: thats fine - its the images that have started appearing that worry me
17:52 <@TeeJay> first ugly people
17:52 <@TeeJay> now ugly naked people
17:52 <@TeeJay> argh!
17:52 <@richardc> no, I think I choose ugly naked people over bugzilla
17:53 <@Trelane> 1usd = 60pence
17:53 <@TeeJay> Trelane: you sure ? I thought you just photocopied monopoly paper with green ink
17:54 <@richardc> that green ink is expensive
17:55 <@TeeJay> john grisham wrote a good book about washing dollar bills and using the paper for printing higher denomination notes
17:55 <@yoda> TeeJay: according to cnn [[ The Treasury plans to redesign bills every 7 to 10 years to keep up with technological advances in counterfeiting ]]   Keep up with? ah, maybe that's the problem
17:55  * CPAN upload: WWW-Mechanize-0.50 by PETDANCE
17:56 <@yoda> TeeJay: the above courtesy of New Scientist
17:56 <@richardc> make your mind up. is it cnn or new scientist
17:57 <@yoda> new scientist were quoting cnn and then adding their own bit
18:08  * Trelane gets an email from BooK asking him if he wants to sign books at YAPC::Europe
18:08 <@richardc> which books?
18:08 <@Kake> didn't know you'd written one.
18:08 <+dipsy> which books are you after?
18:09 <@Trelane> I think they're confused
18:09 <@pdcawley> We sold a copy of C# Essentials, signed by Damian and Alison at YAPC.
18:09 <@mstevens_> say yes! say yes!
18:09 <@pdcawley> Went quite well...
18:09 <@richardc> wrong address, or do they think you're Martin Fowler?

18:10 <@mstevens_> sheriff: www.iii.co.uk ;)
18:10 <@sheriff> oh.
18:10 <@sheriff> Will it cost me money?
18:10 <@mstevens_> sheriff: fool.co.uk probably still do it
18:10 <@mstevens_> sheriff: neither cost money last time I used them.
18:11 <@sheriff> cool
18:11  * sheriff would like to hone his investing skillz before using real money
18:11 <@Trelane> richardc: I assume they think I've published something
18:11 <@richardc> buy a set of dice
18:12 <@Trelane> maybe they think I'm the guy who publishes puzzle books
18:13 <@mstevens_> trelane: just sign whatever it is they put in front of you illegibly
18:13 <@richardc> that'd be cool
18:13 <@mstevens_> sheriff: iii don't allow you to track transaction costs, I can't remember if fool do or don't
18:13 <@mstevens_> but you may not care depending how seriously you're doing it.
18:14 <@Trelane> I'll sign the TT book if it gets published, but it won't by then.  And I only wrote an ickle ickle bit of that in one of the ap.
18:14 <@mstevens_> generally iii is less accurate but a lot easier to use
18:14 <@Dom2> accuracy?  who needs accuracy?
18:15 <@sheriff> ok, thanks
18:15 <@mstevens_> most of the other services let you represent stuff as buys and sells, iii just let you say "I hold this much"
18:16 <@richardc> Dom2: I don't, and nor do my six wives

18:16  * DrHyde is debugging

18:16 <@DrHyde> its definition is followed by more statement handles, $sti, $stj, ...
18:17 <@richardc> :)
18:17 <@Dom2> DrHyde: cool!  You've crossbred fortan and perl!
18:17  * mstevens_ giggles
18:17 <@DrHyde> $stn is defined, and then immediately redefined.  Then used once.
18:17 <@TeeJay> DrHyde: yeep
18:17 <@DrHyde> then redefined (twice) next time it's needed
18:17 <@gellyfish> FABULOUS
18:17 <@Dom2> DrHyde: post to the list!
18:17 <@richardc> take hammer.  apply to side of skull of original author
18:18 <@DrHyde> original author signs paycheques
18:18 <@Dom2> aha
18:18 <@DrHyde> i think i need another cup of tea

18:19  * TeeJay watches chrisa gibber about said perl code
18:19 <@yoda> tea-- # not coffee
18:19 <@TeeJay> yoda-- # tea is far superior to coffee
18:20 <@gellyfish> hey I just had a meeting with SalesFucks and MarketingFucks and didn't kill anyone
18:20 <@Magnus> FRUIT SMOOTHIES RULE OVER TEA OR COFFEE
18:20 <@richardc> gellyfish: you must be getting old
18:20 <@gellyfish> yes this is a worry
18:20 <@TeeJay> gellyfish: get the fuck back in and start hacking with your faithful samurai sword!
18:20 <@yoda> TeeJay: sorry, but coffee smells lovely, tastes lovely, etc. same not said for tea
18:20 <@gellyfish> I don't think I even swore
18:21 <@TeeJay> yoda: I think you may have tongue issues - have you seen a dr about it ?
18:21 <@TeeJay> not liking tea is around the same level as 11th fingers on the mutant scale
18:21 <@yoda> TeeJay: i also don't like hot drinks (at all)
18:22 <@TeeJay> fuckity fuck
18:22 <@richardc> so you drink your coffee cold?
18:22 <@yoda> iced coffee, yep
18:22 <@TeeJay> richardc: cold coffee is frappe
18:22 <@TeeJay> frappe is good
18:22 <@TeeJay> unless you are already cold
18:22 <@richardc> TeeJay: no need to swear
18:22 <@chrisa> TeeJay: no, iced coffee is *horrible*
18:23 <@DrHyde> did i mention magic numbers?  oh yes, i love magic numbers.
18:23 <@chrisa> EB&W even. 
18:23 <@DrHyde> he has lots of "use constant ..." at the top, which is good, but there's still fscking magic numbers all over the place
18:23 <@TeeJay> iced coffee good chrisa bad
18:23 <@chrisa> *mutter*
18:23  * DrHyde wonders what the significane of 1000000350 is
18:23 <@richardc> magic numbers are there to be changed randomly
18:24 <@TeeJay> DrHyde: change it to 7 - 7 is way more magical!
18:24 <+dipsy> TeeJay: that doesn't look right
18:24 <@TeeJay> if that doesn't work try pi
18:24 <@TeeJay> then e
18:24 <@TeeJay> then e/pi
18:24 <@richardc> mmm, pi
18:25 <@DrHyde> grargh
18:25 <@TeeJay> dipsy: pi is <reply>when come back bring 3.14...
18:25 <+dipsy> ...but pi is use constant PI=> 4 * atan2 1, 1; or "processing instruction" in XML or "processing instruction" in SGML or a very good film or http://www.cecm.sfu.ca/projects/pihex/ or at http://3.141592653589793238462643383279502884197169399375105820974944592.net/ or related to the Secret 216-Digit Number...
18:25  * doop likes exp(I*pi)+1.
18:26  * yoda likes use constant five => 4;
18:26 <@mstevens_> mmm, apple pi
18:26 <@pdcawley> if (six were nine)?
18:26 <@TeeJay> mstevens_: soft boiled egg (large) is far superior in texture
18:26 <@DrHyde> mmm, global variables

18:46 <@Magnus> twart?
18:46 <@Greg> Magnus: its like the other word but with genital warts, HTH
18:46 <@Magnus> cool
18:46 <@baud> is perl 5.8.0's rand() now /dev/random or still glibc's?
18:47  * pdcawley hopes it's glibc's
18:47 <@baud> pdcawley: why?
18:47 <@Magnus> so if I am a vagina with genital warts
18:47 <@Magnus> what is blech
18:47 <+dipsy> blech is probably a wastrel
18:47 <@richardc> baud: it looks like it's /dev/urandom, if defines are set
18:48 <@pdcawley> Because it's a documented pseudorandom/repeatable randomu number generated.
18:48 <@Magnus> dipsy, Magnus is also a twart

18:48 <@sheriff> What was wrong with changing factoids to simply <reply>?

19:09 <@TeeJay> nah - I use q{}
19:09 <@sheriff> blech - the concept of a semi-colon? Nothing; using them to seperate an exclamation from a sentence is wrong, however

22:24 < droogs> XML::Simple doesn't have many requirements and its um... ok once you get used to it
22:25 < droogs> sheriff: sweet :)
22:25 <@DrHyde> it requires XML::Parser, which requires ...

22:26 < droogs> you are running debian which includes more c and perl xml libs than you can shake a very shakey stick at, aren't you ?

22:28 < droogs> how fucked up is that ?
22:28 < droogs> I've been in the zetnet office
22:28 < droogs> when I lived in shetland
22:29 <@DrHyde> hooray for XML::Parser and its undocumentedness
22:30  * DrHyde gets it to compile by reading the Makefile.PL
22:31 < droogs> DrHyde: its perl, its readable - what more do you want
22:31  * droogs had some modules that required modules for testing and didn't mention them so make test always failed
22:31 <@DrHyde> god forbid that the incantation to tell make where to find the C library should be documented in the README, oh no, of course not, no need for documentation, this is XML, it's EASY
22:31 < droogs> gah
22:32 <@sheriff> This is so much easier using an operating system with a packages/ports system
22:33 <@DrHyde> every single packages/ports system is broken
22:33 <@sheriff> this is true
22:33 <@sheriff> but then everything is broken
22:33 <+dipsy> i already had it that way, sheriff.
22:33 <@sheriff> Some things are less broken than other tho
22:33 <@sheriff> and ports made installing AxKit on FreeBSD a breeze, and that required XML::Parser, I believe
22:34 <@DrHyde> however, if the module had been properly documented i wouldn't have had to bitch about it so much
22:34 <@sheriff> If the author was lathos, you'd be pretty close to making him leave open-source right now!

22:49 <@DrHyde> oh great, my mail to the author bounced
22:50 <@sheriff> richardc - I can see what's explained. What's explained is that Email::Simple doesn't do the nice thing and silently discard the header yet. What isn't there is the logic behind this decision.
22:50 <@sheriff> Considering it seems a pretty common case
22:50 <@richardc> the logic is we're doing RFC2822 stuff. and FROM_ isn't in RFC2822, so it can fuck off
22:51 <@sheriff> Doesn't RFC2822 say to discard malformed headers?
22:51 <@richardc> no

11:19 <@UnderMine> things moving fast then?
11:21 <@AlexMc> Kake: in CGI::Wiki is there a way to do #REDIRECT realname
11:21 <@AlexMc> or does it depend on your cgi script
11:21 <@AlexMc> I have to code it into my wiki.cgi
11:22 <@AlexMc> http://www.sflink.net/gopherit/wiki.cgi?node=Domain_Name_Service
11:23 <@Kake> Yes, put it in your wiki.cgi
11:23 <@AlexMc> bummer
11:23 <@AlexMc> I really must do a full Usemod clone example
11:24 <@AlexMc> Kake: Is there an "easy" way of enhancing the object which formats the wiki text which was written by chromatic?
11:24 -!- muttoff is now known as muttley
11:24 <@Kake> I don't think I can parse that sentence.
11:24 <@AlexMc> Kake: Have you considered subclassing it and re-implementing certain features
11:24 <@Kake> What are you trying to do?
11:25 <@AlexMc> CGI::Wiki uses I think Text::Wiki....
11:25 <@AlexMc> right?
11:25 <@Kake> Two of the three formatters use Text::WikiFormat, yes.
11:25  * AlexMc wonders why he doesn'tcheck himself
11:25 <@AlexMc> sorry  Text::WikiFormat
11:25 <@Kake> It's not easily subclassable.  What are you trying to do that it doesn't do?
11:27 <@AlexMc> Kake: I want it to behave exactly like UseMod for weirdoslike me who are replacing Usemod systems
11:28 <@AlexMc> It is a low priority thing though
11:28 <@Kake> Yes, that's the aim of the usemod formatter.
11:28 <@Kake> Give me specifics! :)
11:28 <@richardc> Kake: pie is nice
11:29 <@Kake> Mmmm pie.
11:29 <@AlexMc> Kake: it may be me using the Usemod formatter wrong :-)
11:29 <@AlexMc> pie?
11:29 <+dipsy> mmm... pie!
11:29 <@AlexMc> thank you dipsy
11:29 <@AlexMc> wiki?
11:29 <+dipsy> wiki is, like, a world editable database of web pages or at http://c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki or london specific - see grubstreet or http://londongeek.org/
11:30 <@Kake> Alex, please please please can I have a bug report?
11:30 <@Kake> Please?
11:30 <@AlexMc> Kake: next time I enhance http://www.sflink.net/gopherit/wiki.cgi I will
11:30 <@AlexMc> but frankly wouldn't you prefer a patch/solution as well?
11:30 <@AlexMc> :-)
11:31 <@richardc> see, enchance, that's a funny word when it comes to diagnosing bugs
11:31 <@Kake> I'd prefer a bug report over lots of "it doesn't work" on IRC.
11:31 <@AlexMc> Kake: I was randomly whinging about Chromatic's code, not yours :-)
11:31  * Kake gives up/
11:32 <@AlexMc> whinging is just to make me feel better, not necessarily to actually do anything
11:32 <@AlexMc> CGI::Wiki is still great, and still the tool I recommend people to use.
11:32 <@Greg> i recommend pie or ninja's depending on the job ;-)
11:33 <@AlexMc> ninja?
11:33 <+dipsy> ninja are cunning
11:33 <@Kake> Alex, I'm asking for a bug report as much for my benefit as yours.  I would like my code to work.  If you've found a bit that doesn't, then that's great, and even greater if you tell me what the problem is so I can fix it.
11:33 <@AlexMc> Kake: ok ok, no problem, will do as you ask
11:33 <@gellyfish> Kake++
11:33 <@Kake> Cool, thanks.
11:33 <@AlexMc> just have to get my life in order first
11:34  * Quidity yawns
11:34 <@richardc> what?
11:34 <@Greg> doing a bug report will help you get your life in order
11:34 <@Greg> start with the simple things, e.g. mailing kate the bug
11:34 <@AlexMc> Greg: knowing who I will be working for mid July will get my life in order.
11:34 <@richardc> and then move onto more complex things like wondering where you're going to get new kneecaps from
11:35 <@AlexMc> NHS?
11:35 <+dipsy> i heard NHS was only funded by government, not part of government.
11:35  * CPAN upload: NestedMap-1.0 by DCANTRELL
11:35 <@Kake> Gosh.  Someone's written an IRC bot to play bingo.
11:37 <@Greg> you don't need a bot to play bingo on IRC, for instance my card for today has '_Dave to witter on about jobstats', 'somebody to to talk about some crack fuelled idea involving XML, graphs and class inheritance' and 'general whining'
11:37 <@AlexMc> someone talks about fast seduction
11:38 <@Kake> Nah, Magnus is at Glastonbury.
11:38 <@Greg> AlexMc: you'd be on to a loser there, Magnus is away
11:38 <@chrisa> but no one asks 'what should i take to glasto' any more ...
11:38 <@AlexMc> I said "someone"
11:38 <@Greg> FS = Magnus
11:38 <@AlexMc> but we could all talk about how Magnus is full of shit sometimes
11:38 <@AlexMc> mind you I don't like bingo, so wont play
11:39 <@Greg> but that would be nasty talking about him behind his back and i tend to disagree
11:39 <@AlexMc> www.tantrix.com is a good game
11:39 <@richardc> but if we were to start doing that we'd have to move around the channel, and that'd lead to upset
11:39  * TeeJay wrestles with an over-engineered login page
11:40 <@Greg> TeeJay: does it involve Class inheritance, XML and graphs?
11:40  * UnderMine TeeJay: Enjoy ... it is real fun that one
11:40 <@Greg> or have you mapped it out yet using autodia perhaps - please tell us about it if you have
11:40 <@richardc> dipsy: summon robin_sz
11:40 <+dipsy> ROBIN_SZ ROBIN_SZ ROBIN_SZ ROBIN_SZ ROBIN_SZ COME TO ME
11:41 <@AlexMc> changing the subject....
11:41 <@AlexMc> Do people like the Register front page?
11:41 <@AlexMc> I was wondering about using its headline table layout
11:41 <@AlexMc> instead of the slash style layout I currently use
11:42 <@richardc> I can recount running battles of how that page got built, if you like
11:42 <@Kake> Casey's use.perl journal is turning into a livejournal parody.
11:42 <@AlexMc> richardc: will it be educational, entertaining, or erudite?
11:43 <@richardc> basically the lead designer hated doing it, but was intracted to make it newspapery
11:43 <@richardc> s/intracted/instructed/
11:43 <@AlexMc> I basically want far more articles to appear on the front page.
11:43 <@richardc> so he mocked up this really cheesy thing, with a curl in the bottom corner
11:43  * Kake wonders also whether TeeJay's account of how he spent an hour working on autodia took more than an hour to write.
11:44 <@richardc> and they test-ran that, and kept everything but the curl
11:44 <@chrisa> AlexMc: you probably shouldn't copy the 'random reordering of stories' that El Reg seems to have... 
11:45 <@AlexMc> chrisa: no... just the latest....
11:45 <@Quidity> And maybe miss out the "reprinting press releases" thing they do.
11:45 <@AlexMc> Quidity: I only do around one press release per year so that wont be a problem
11:45 <@AlexMc> or do you mean press releases received from other firms?
11:46 <@AlexMc> I'll reprint a press release from O'Reilly, or about any book I am interested in.
11:46 <@chrisa> in the Reg's case, anyone, it seems
11:47 <@AlexMc> DiverseBooks.com / DiverseDVD.com reprints maybe one in ten press releases that we receive if I think is interesting.

12:12 <@TeeJay> why oh why?
12:12 <@iamcal> nice
12:13 <@Kake> Is it in Meta::* ?
12:13  * davorg has written a module that exported one variable
12:13 <@davorg> but it was a big, complex hash
12:14 <@davorg> and i put access methods around it too
12:14 <@TeeJay> this is quite a big but fairly simple hash
12:14 <@Kake> OK, I have subscribed to london.class now; you can all start posting.
12:14 <@TeeJay> used by about 3 cgi scripts
12:14 <@richardc> Kake: hahahaha
12:14 <@AlexMc> Is London.class publicised outside of London.pm?
12:14 <@mstevens> alex: it's not publicised *inside* london.pm
12:14 <@AlexMc> mstevens: :-)
12:14 <@iamcal> is simon cozens in this channel/what name does he use on irc?
12:15 <@mstevens> alex: but it has, err, about 30 subscribers, I think.
12:15 <@muttley> Ok, got a film quiz for you clever people
12:15 <+pasty> "muttley" at 217.10.129.148 pasted Film Quiz at http://paste.husk.org/55
12:15 <@Kake> iamcal: He is lathos, but he's in Japan for 5 weeks.
12:15 <@iamcal> thanks Kake
12:15 <@mstevens> I quite like it being only london.pm people, although I admit a mailing list with no posts isn't worth much, even if all the posts are of the highest quality
12:15  * AlexMc is stressed
12:16 <@Kake> mstevens: Give me my first task!
12:16 <@AlexMc> mstevens: I think that we need more people in london.class whether or not they are perl programmers
12:16 <@TeeJay> dipsy: bracknell ?
12:16 <+dipsy> teejay: bugger all, i dunno
12:16 <@AlexMc> Kake: your first task is to find more people for london.class
12:16 <@mstevens> kake: you must find the jade falcon... urr, maybe it should involve java
12:16 <@Kake> It would help if it involved java, yes.
12:17 <@Quidity> Oh, I see.
12:17 <@AlexMc> and XML? Kake
12:17 <@vorsprung> so london.class is like london.pm for java nutz
12:17 <@TeeJay> bracknell is a script or module that seems to be ok if you enter and exit it quickly, but is truly awful if you have to linger
12:17 <@AlexMc> Kake: want a java book to review?
12:17 <@Kake> I don't mind if it has XML, but the main aim is for me to learn Java.
12:17 <@AlexMc> vorsprung: yes, except not
12:17 <@davorg> muttley: the elephant & miss fitzgerald is "Barbarella"
12:17 <@mstevens> vorsprung: except without any posts.
12:17 <@davorg> and eve is probably "The First Lady"
12:17 <@Kake> Alex, hm, not really, not really into book reviewing any more.
12:18 <@AlexMc> oh well
12:18 <@AlexMc> worth asking
12:18 <@mstevens> kake: hello world ;) 
12:18 <@AlexMc> Kake: write an article explaining EJB to perl programmers
12:19 <@aef> London.class is a bit ungooglable :)
12:19 <@iamcal> Joseph's brother kept out of public eye => private benjamin

12:19 <@vorsprung> iamcal, ha! yes
12:19 <@Kake> Bah :)  OK.  It'll probably take me a little while to figure out what I need to install and how to use it, so that's quite a good one.
12:19 <@Kake> aef: Add "mailing list"
12:20 <@aef> Ah. It's a London.pm thing.
12:20 <@muttley> Dave - yeah, that's what I had
12:20 <@mstevens> kake: there are reasons why it's the first thing in every programming book :) Plus, you can do lots of variants like hello servlet world, hello database world, hello ejb world...
12:20 <@muttley> but barbarella is genius. 
12:21 <@muttley> I'm wondering if Polish up some Granite is The Shining
12:21 <@AlexMc> Kake: hello world portlet for Jetspeed?
12:21 <@Kake> Alex: I only understood 60% of the words in that sentence.
12:22 <@mstevens> kake: I suggest hello figlet world as a second thing.
12:22 <@vorsprung> mstevens, hello world in junit
12:22 <@mstevens> vorsprung: but junit is pants
12:23 <@acme> as bad a perlunit?
12:23 <@vorsprung> mstevens, it's all I ever write java programs with :)
12:23 <@vorsprung> nah junit is better than perlunit
12:23 <@acme> utwente++ # fast
12:23 <@Quidity> That's not saying anything.
12:23 <@Quidity> Junit blows testing goats.
12:23 <@vorsprung> mstevens, so oh great java genius what is better for testing java programs?
12:24 <@mstevens> vorsprung: nah, it's all pants.
12:24 <@vorsprung> ?
12:24 <@Quidity> Nothing, but that doesn't make junit not pants.
12:24 <@Quidity> It's like being hit on the head.
12:24 <@vorsprung> soooo
12:24 <@vorsprung> junit is rubbish (why?) but there is nothing better??
12:24 <@AlexMc> but what is better than junit?
12:24 <@mstevens> It's not good, like, say, Test::More
12:25 <@AlexMc> I am thinking of doing something with junit just to putit on the cv
12:25 <@vorsprung> is this why I usually avoid java ? :)

12:26 <@gellyfish> okay
12:26 <@vorsprung> gellyfish, what if I'm not writing .net :)
12:26 <@gellyfish> that can't be helped
12:26 <@gellyfish> We'd just have to kill you
12:27 <@vorsprung> i still don't understand what is so bad about junit
12:27  * Kake waits for 18 meg of stuff to download and install.
12:28  * muttley hehs at "I have seen it discussed - is it good? Who cares. It's not like you get a new Harry Potter book every day, you have to treasure this shit. I don't slink home from the solar eclipse and be like, well, I've seen more invigorating natural phenomena. I know now the dark depths and dizzying highs of true fandom, and don't fuck with me about this because I've got a nine hundred page hardcover in my grip. I'll bat your head clean off and start run
12:28 <@hex> coo, Rafiq is giving a talk.
12:29 <@acme> today i will be in colt. that book will keep me sane while syssies do whatever they do
12:31 <@mstevens> vorsprung: there's too much overhead to get to the "I'm going to run a test now" stage, the TestSuite stuff is a bit crap, the assert() methods don't feel quite right, I don't like the fact it runs the tests in the same JVM as the thing doing the testing, the docs seem a bit pattern-infected, I don't like the fact you don't declare the number of tests you're going to do.
12:31 <@mstevens> this is why I don't like it, anyway.
12:31 <@Quidity> Yes, there's too much cut and paste crap
12:32  * gellyfish hands nuttley the pony
12:32 <@vorsprung> isn't java like that though, cutting and pasting like a madman
12:32 <@mstevens> vorsprung: you're meant to get an IDE to cut-and-paste for you
12:32 <@vorsprung> i agree about the number of tests thing
12:32 <@vorsprung> mstevens, yes I know...magic java editors
12:32 <@TeeJay> vorsprung: you forgot the drawing UML diagrams and then the cutting and the pasting
12:33 <@vorsprung> TeeJay, hehe you are supposed to use a roundtrip automatic code generator for that :)
12:34 <@vorsprung> more coffee needed

12:46 <+dipsy> "I must not attend meetings. Meetings are the mind killer. Meetings are the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my meeting. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the wasted time has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain."
12:49 <@TeeJay> gah the CVS monster ate my files
12:51 <@Kake> Oops.  I broke my chair.  Not bad timing though.
12:51 <@TeeJay> CVS++ # didn't eat my files after all, they weren't added until after the tag I merged in
12:52 <@Dom2> Kake: chairs are evil like that
12:57 <@TeeJay> which bit of tubular bells has the theme from TheExorcist ?
12:57 <@TeeJay> torque?
12:57 <+dipsy> torque is probably a quite cool XML format for storing DB schema found at http://jakarta.apache.org/turbine/torque/
12:58  * TeeJay is considering working on a perl equivilent to turbine and lucene
12:58 <@TeeJay> it may take some time
12:59 <@TeeJay> dipsy: hobbit time ?
12:59 <+dipsy> somewhere between second breakfast and elevenses
13:00 <@Kake> Cool, Katy's found a bar that has slaves with fans.

13:03 <+dipsy> greg was last seen on #london.pm 1 hours, 23 minutes and 24 seconds ago, saying: or have you mapped it out yet using autodia perhaps - please tell us about it if you have [Thu Jun 26 09:37:55 2003]
13:03 < jouke_> greg is gone?
13:04 <@AlexMc> meetings?
13:04 <+dipsy> Meetings - the exciting alternative to work!
13:05 <@AlexMc> TeeJay: if you work on a perl equivalent to turbine et al then I'll help :-)
13:06 <@Dom2> mozilla-- # crashed again
13:06 <@TeeJay> AlexMc: cool
13:06 <@chrisa> what's Turbine then?
13:06 <@TeeJay> I like the torque schema thing
13:06 <@AlexMc> eudora-- # crashes too
13:06 <@TeeJay> can already parse it
13:07 <@AlexMc> Turbine is the best web application framework that I know
13:07 <@TeeJay> can probably use OF, etc

13:08 <@AlexMc> jetspeed?
13:08 <@chrisa> oh no, they have a thing called 'POI' !
13:08 <@AlexMc> dipsy, jetspeed is a cool portal system developed by Apache java people
13:08 <+dipsy> OK, AlexMc.
13:09 <@AlexMc> dipsy, turbine is a cool java based web application framework - but isn't struts
13:09 <+dipsy> ...but turbine is the best web application framework that I know...
13:09 <@AlexMc> dipsy, jetspeed is also implemented using turbine
13:09 <+dipsy> okay, AlexMc.

13:09 < jouke_> does anyone happen to know when Greg will be back?
13:09 <@TeeJay> POI is a way of interacting with broken nasty windoze stuff
13:10 <@AlexMc> I think the two POI's do the same thing though dont they?
13:10 <@AlexMc> doing things like reading and writing MS Windows files
13:10 <@gellyfish> you mean the greg we killed and buried under the patio?
13:10 <@chrisa> hmm. 'uck PO' then.

15:16 <@Dom2> I was just trying out autodia on my database and wondering why I couldn't load a DBI driver called "dbi".
15:16 <@desnarf> is it possible to get apache to redirect according to the remote IP?
15:16 <@Dom2> desnarf: should be, you'll probably have to use mod_rewrite though
15:17 <@desnarf> aha cool, i'll investigate this cheers
15:17 <@Dom2> desnarf: You can probably do it by using Setenvif and then basing the rewrite rule on that
15:17 <@Dom2> Or alternatively, rewritecond will probably handle it for you

15:19 <@davorg> it's very nasty. we use it here.
15:19 <@mstevens_> davorg: yes
15:19 <@Dom2> TeeJay: I'm just going to play with it for a bit, I think
15:19 <@davorg> it's an object that stores all of its instance data in package variables.
15:19 <@davorg> like it wants to be a singleton
15:20 <@davorg> but it isn't
15:20 <@Dom2> ewwww
15:20 <@Dom2> sounds gross
15:20 <@davorg> which is kinda scary
15:20 <@Quidity> It's funny when that happens.
15:20 <@Quidity> So long as you can watch from the sidelines.
15:20 <@PerfDave> Good tutorials for an idiot's guide to using mod_perl for more than cacheing DB handles and CGI scripts/
15:20 <@mstevens_> perfdave: I liked the mod_perl book
15:21 <@davorg> _the_ mod_perl book?
15:21 <@mstevens_> davorg: it's a bit unpleasant. I think Net::SMTP is floating around there though.
15:21 <@PerfDave> As in "Ptogramming Apache modules with Perl and C"?
15:21 <@Dom2> PerfDave: practical mod_perl just came out from ORA...
15:21 <@PerfDave> That looked a bit hardcore for somebody of as little brane as I
15:21 <@davorg> mstevens_: yeah. it uses Net:SMTP
15:22 <@gem> PerfDave: nope its a nice simple book
15:22 <@gem> i recommend it

15:22 <@mstevens_> davorg: IIRC I stripped stuff down to just Net::SMTP whenever I had an excuse.
15:22 <@davorg> PerfDave: either the mod_perl Developers' Cookbook or Practical mod_perl - both are good
15:22  * PerfDave goes to poke around ORA.com
15:23 <@davorg> the developer's cookbook is from Sams
15:23 <@Dom2> the eagle book is good, but getting dated now
15:23 <@mstevens_> davorg: I think there may be a few other classes that store instance data in the package.
15:24 <@Dom2> one thing that I've noted with all mod_perl books is that they tend to write code that you wouldn't consider good elsewhere for "performance" reasons
15:24 <@mstevens_> I remember them, but I'm not sure if they still eixst.
15:24 <@davorg> the sooner this site gets closed down the better :)
15:24 <@Dom2> I find it annoying in a book which is meant to teach you stuff
15:24 <@davorg> mstevens_: is this because the authors didn't know how to write classes?
15:25 <@mstevens_> davorg: I couldn't possibly comment
15:25 <@davorg> mstevens_: and who is this "Jon Morby" anyway?
15:25 <@Dom2> Jon Morby?

15:25 <@gem> PerfDave: ..PAC
15:25 <@AlexMc> Jon Morby?
15:25 <@Dom2> Jon Morby used to be the Demon Mail system Developer
15:25 <@davorg> he's left his mobile phone number in the comments 
15:25 <@Dom2> He runs fido.net
15:26 <@Dom2> He's bloody uselsss
15:26 <@gem> but im just talking about that book not a comparison
15:26 <@davorg> ah. hence Fido::Sendmail
15:26 <@Dom2> He's the reason demon never got anywhere with MMDF
15:26  * Dom2 twitches
15:26 <@PerfDave> Practical mod-perl is looking good.
15:26 <@davorg> well, he's also the reason why i'm currently trracking down this bug
15:26 <@Dom2> davorg: take it, burn it, feed it to the crows
15:27 <@mstevens_> davorg: some of the iii code isn't that bad
15:27 <@Dom2> davorg: from that I gather that his working habits did not change after he left demon

15:40 <@Kake> I think the london.food list is broken.  The web interface certainly is.
15:41 <@gem> sheriff: pick one
15:41 <@TeeJay> there is definately somthing in the air of shetland that persuades you that actually growing a big beard and wearing great bit wooly jumpers is a great idea and sure to attract a fine wife
15:41 <@Kake> PerfDave: I dunno.  I tend to comment on food- or pub-related things.
15:41 <@gem> cheap != nice in london
15:41 <@Kake> sheriff: Mail the list and beg for crash space.
15:41 <@PerfDave> sheriff: Retire to Victoria, 24 hour netcafe. Stay up, drink coffee.
15:41 <@sheriff> Kake - I will have a g/f with me
15:41 <@gem> unless you are willing to negotiate at the last minute
15:41 <@gem> then you can get it down to 60 quid a night for nice
15:42 <@Kake> If you're very lucky you might get me or doop replying and offering you a room.  But I'm not yet sure of my weekend plans.
15:42 <@mstevens_> perfdave: I've done that a few times. It gets very quiet about 5am.
15:42 <@sheriff> I seem to remember you being a long long way from the tube station
15:42 <@PerfDave> Kake: I posted about stir fry last night :p
15:42 <@mstevens_> IIRC being very happy when burger king opened so I could get coffee
15:42 <@sheriff> We have a room in Fleet if we want it, but Fleet may be difficult to get to
15:42 <@gem> sheriff: the taxi fair might be less than a nice hotel room
15:43 <@sheriff> to Fleet? It's about £100
15:43 <@Kake> We're a short bus ride from the tube station.  Certainly a taxi would be less than 15 quid from Hammersmith to us.
15:43 <@Kake> PerfDave: Ah, will go look.
15:43  * sheriff will think about all this tomorrow when he plans his holiday
15:43  * Kake gets all excited about Wednesday.
15:43  * mstevens_ is going on holiday in august
15:44  * mstevens_ doesn't know where he's going
15:44 <@mstevens_> kake: what happens wednesday?
15:44 <@sheriff> mstevens_ - Go to Iceland
15:44 <@Kake> I become unemployed!
15:44 <@mstevens_> yay!
15:44 <@mstevens_> sheriff: I was thinking of going to see more perl mongers somewhere
15:44 <@PerfDave> mstevens_: I wouldn't, you might get cooties :)

16:22 <@claes> rataxis : my parents are swedish
16:22 <@vorsprung> claes, are you named after a mainline railway station?
16:22 <@mstevens> is there an instant certification-authority-inna-ox out there? I'm getting really bored of driving openssl by hand.

16:23 <@mstevens> vorsprung: something a bit more droolproof
16:24 <@vorsprung> mstevens, you could put CA.pl behind a web interface
16:24 <@vorsprung> mstevens, with a 1,2,3 menu

16:40 < frabcus> Hello
16:40 <+dipsy> que tal, frabcus
16:41 <@richardc> gellyfish: do it over easter, people will be really impressed when you wake from the dead
16:42 < frabcus> I've got a question about CR/LF characters _in_ URLs and WWW::Mechanize, where's a good place to ask?
16:42 <@Kake> LUNCH NOW
16:42 <@davorg> frabcus: perhaps on a perl irc channel
16:43 <@davorg> like this one
16:43 < frabcus> That's a good idea.  I thought maybe this was one?
16:43 <@vorsprung> has someone written a WWW::Mechanise::Proxy that auto records stuff yet?
16:44 < frabcus> OK. I'm parsing a website which has some <a> tags with a CR/LF in the href attribute.
16:44 < frabcus> Visual browsers strip these out at some point, and browse the link correctly.
16:44 < frabcus> With WWW::Mechanize, it escapes the CR/LF and tries to download a URL with them in it, getting 404 errors.
16:44 <@Dom2> frabcus: in the middle of the URL or before/after it?
16:44 < frabcus> In the middle.
16:45 <@davorg> is that valid?
16:45 <@Dom2> frabcus: then they're wrong to do so :)
16:45 <@Dom2> davorg: valid, yes.
16:45 < frabcus> That's what I want to know.
16:45 <@Dom2> davorg: strictly in DTD terms
16:45 <@richardc> it's probably a valid way of specifing a uri with crlf in
16:45 <@Dom2> davorg: But in reality, I suspect that it's crap
16:45 < frabcus> Does it violate SGML?  Or does it violate HTML?  Or the URI specification?
16:45 < frabcus> For added amusement, it's a page from Hansard: http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm/cmvol395.htm
16:45 <@Dom2> frabcus: I don't think it violates the DTD, but I'd check the page on the W3C validator
16:46 <@richardc> probably non of the above.  the page author has violated common sense though
16:46 <@Dom2> http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.publications.parliament.uk%2Fpa%2Fcm%2Fcmvol395.htm
16:46 <@Dom2> richardc: I would suspect that the contents of the href would be an invalid URI
16:47 < frabcus> Not according to validator.w3.org.
16:47 <@richardc> Dom2: stop that or you'll ruin my fun of randomly guessing and make me look at the uri spec again
16:47 < frabcus> It complains about everything else on the page, but not about the broken URL line 140/141
16:47 <@davorg> but the correct urls have the cr/lf removed
16:47 <@Dom2> frabcus: Oh, it's invalid for a number of reasons, but in and of itself, the CRLF in the middle of href problem is /probably/ valid.
16:48 <@davorg> so the page is broken
16:48 <@davorg> and visual browsers are compensating
16:48 <@Dom2> frabcus: the quickest thing to do is probably to mail the author of the module and mention it to him.
16:49 < frabcus> The big question is, which module?
16:49 <@Dom2> frabcus: Andy Lester is pretty responsive to this sort of thing.
16:49 <@Dom2> frabcus: WWW::Mechanize, didn't you say?
16:49  * Quidity returns to cheltenham.
16:49 < frabcus> That's the high level interface I'm using.  But it could really be in HTML::TokeParser, or URL::URI that a fix/workaround is required.
16:49 <@richardc> no
16:49 <@PerfDave> scribot: http://www.electricnews.net/news.html?code=9365210 # European software patents "inevitable"
16:50 <@davorg> or you could shout at the author of the broken page
16:50 <@Dom2> frabcus: Mail WWW::Mechanize's author.  That's meant to be doing what a browser would do, so the compensation should probably occur there.
16:50 <@Dom2> davorg: hansard.  is it likely to be fixed?
16:50 <@richardc> the parser should parse it accurately, if the link follower in mechanise wants to fudge for bad pages, that's where it should go
16:50 <@davorg> Dom2: prolly not. but it would give me pleasure
16:51 <@Dom2> davorg: Actually, I've just looked at the source properly.  It's really,  really fucked
16:51 < frabcus> davorg, Dom2:  I do intend to contact Hansard a bit more about all the problems with their pages.  Believe me, their are some actual democratic flaws (ambiguous records of MPs voting, for example)
16:51 <@Dom2> davorg: It appears to have *2* <html> elements. :(
16:51 <@davorg> excellent :)
16:51 <@Dom2> their CM must be so shit
16:52 < frabcus> Dom2: Yes, I'd love to know how they make it.  I'm hoping if I can attract enough attention I'll find out.
16:52 <@Dom2> frabcus: If you feel up to it, please do so
16:52 <@richardc> right, read this nice new book on cvs, or hack on apache::template?
16:52 <@Dom2> frabcus: But I'd definitely let Andy Lester know about the issue - he may well put in a fix.
16:52 < frabcus> When I've got a bit further I will.  I'll mail Andy, thanks!
16:52 <@davorg> richardc: is that the ORA book on CVS?
16:53 < frabcus> Thank you for all your help.  It's nice to find friendly people so easily ;)
16:53 <@Dom2> friendly?  us?  what happened? :)
16:53 <@richardc> davorg: yup, essential CVS.  amazon fairy brought an office copy this morning
16:53 <@davorg> pc bookshop didn't have a copy last friday
16:53 <@richardc> Dom2: I blame the nice weather
16:53 <@davorg> maybe i'll try again on the way home
16:54 <@richardc> from what I've skimmed it's damn good
16:54 <@davorg> thanks for the review :)
16:55 <@richardc> though there is a bit of filler in chap2 where it's telling you about the many ways you can install CVS on your given platform
16:55  * davorg reads emails about more redundancies
16:55 <@richardc> it does build from source, apt-get, rpm, and yast, complete with screenshots
16:56 < frabcus> In case you're interested, and to let you know what I'm doing as way of thanks;  I'm parsing the voting record from Hansard into a database.
16:56 <@richardc> which makes for 6 highly skippable pages

16:57 <@richardc> yeah, but in the context of the rest of the chapter, it's pure padding
16:59 < frabcus> There's a first rough static version at http://www.flourish.org/~publicwhip
16:59 < frabcus> But the source data is so bad it's taking me ages to parse back further in time ;)
17:01 <@davorg> looks good tho 
17:02 < frabcus> Perl rules :)  I spent two days looking for screen scraper tools before finding WWW::Mechanize.  It's the best.
17:02 <@davorg> so why are you using php for the site?
17:03 < frabcus> davorg: Because PHP rules too ;)
17:04 <@Nicholas> is WWW::Mechanize::Shell useful?
17:05 < frabcus> I've never used it, it seemed a bit eccentric.  The feature to output Perl code equivalent to your session is the only thing that actually makes it useful, i think.

17:10 <+dipsy> andy lester is pretty responsive to this sort of thing.
17:10 <@richardc> probably not this one
17:11 < rataxis> possibly not. which one does frabcus mean?
17:11 < frabcus> rataxis: The maintainer of WWW::Mechanize

17:12 <@Dom2> richardc: Oh, I dunno, I think there's a case to be made for putting that fix in WWW::Mechanize
17:12 <@richardc> what fix?
17:12 <+dipsy> fix is probably *** HELLO DON'T RUN THIS ON A LIVE DB LALALALALAL ***
17:12 <@Dom2> richardc: And failing that, he'll probably have helpful suggestions about where to correctly put a fix
17:12 <@Dom2> richardc: CR in href attr
17:12 < frabcus> Dom2: ?  I think perhaps it should be in TokeParser.
17:12 <@richardc> I said it should go in WWW::Mechanize
17:13 <@Dom2> richardc: my apologies; I appear to have misread you
17:13 <@richardc> not in TokeParser
17:13 <@richardc> I also said it about half an hour ago, which is why you took me unawares
17:13 < rataxis> frabcus : ah, probably not the same one then.
17:13 <@Dom2> richardc: I'm sorry; It's Friday and I'm being slow
17:14 <@richardc> it's okay, it's Friday :)
17:14 < frabcus> richardc:  Oh I see, because it is perfectly valid HTML, and a perfectly valid URL.  Just in practice nobody ever uses them, so the higher level browser (WWW::Mechanize) is the place to compensate.

17:18 <@Dom2> You do my ($name, $number) = m//
17:19 < dunc> this is all fine and fun... but it only works if the regex is in $_ 
17:19 < dunc> really?  how does m// work? 
17:19 <@gellyfish> that's fine
17:19 <@Dom2> same as //
17:19 <@nik> dunc: my($a, $b, $c) = $_ =~ /(..)foo(...)/
17:19 <@richardc> you mean string. the regex stays inside the m
17:19 <@davorg> my ($name, $number) = $foo =~ /.../;
17:19 <@gellyfish> then my ($foo, bar ) = $shshs =~ m/ ... /;
17:20 < dunc> sooo if i wanted to use m// it would be my($a, $b, $c) = $_ =~ /(..)foo(...)/
17:20 < dunc> [16:16] <@richardc> you mean string. the regex stays inside the m

18:37 <@vorsprung> davorg, it's the best way

18:38 <@Kake> I have many computers.
18:38 <@DrHyde> of course, loading the data in involves some pretty hairy transformations on it too, which can also produce bugs
18:39 <@richardc> eee, when I was a lad I had test failures before I even run the test suite
18:39 <@DrHyde> no doubt if i'd bothered reading davorg's book he'd have told me how to make it all just magically work

19:53 <@Kake> First of all, the process just wouldn't run at all; I fixed that and went to lunch.  When I got back there was an answerphone message saying that one dealer's details hadn't updated, I just figured out 5 minutes ago how to solve that.
19:53 <@Kake> Probably.
19:53 <@richardc> cool
19:53 <@Kake> And once this has finished reindexing and I've sent mail and made phone call I can go HOME.
19:57 <@mstevens> hmm, almost hometime
19:59 <@Kake> You'd think the BADA could afford an answerphone, pah.

22:09  * mstevens is sure cycling isn't supposed to make your arm feel numb
22:09 <@Kake> Perhaps you're doing it wrong.
22:10 <@Kake> Did you use a bicycle?
22:10 <@mstevens> yes
22:10 <@Kake> Well, that's a good start.
22:10  * mstevens isn't a complete idiot
22:11 <@mstevens> there are bits missing
22:11 <@Kake> From you or the bike?
22:11 <@mstevens> from me, in a 'not a complete idiot' sensew
22:11 <@Kake> Heh.
22:13 <@Kake> The Selfridges web site is crap.  All I wanted to know was whether they had a haberdashery department.
22:13 <@Kake> And it can't even tell me that.
22:14 <@bob> surely google will know
22:17 <@mstevens> hmm, arm still slightly numb
22:18 <@Kake> Google suggests I should go to John Lewis instead.
22:19 <@bob> yes
22:21 <@Shevek> What are you looking for, Kake?
22:22  * Shevek pokes Kake.
22:25 <@Kake> Sorry, had to go get pizza out of oven.  Crochet stuff.
22:26 <@Kake> I've been making things for Katy's baby (due early December) but I need to get a pattern for a jacket, and the right yarn, and some more hooks cos I only seem to have a size 3 one here, which is OK but not very flexible.
22:29  * itz_ wonders if there is a bluewave reader for unix
22:29 <@Shevek> John Lewis sucks totally.
22:29  * mstevens was always a QWK kiddie 
22:30 <@Shevek> Actually, they do have patterns.
22:30 <@Shevek> I forgot that.
22:30 <@yoda> well, alfie and kat have /finally/ got it together. therefore i'm feeling even more shit than normal
22:30 <@itz_> pcboard and qwk downloads!
22:30 <@Kake> Where would be a good place to go?
22:31 <@Shevek> Erm. Trouble is I live out here in the sticks, so I know places out here.
22:31 <@Shevek> Also I do dressmaking not crochet.
22:32 <@Shevek> But JL do have patterns.
22:32 <@Shevek> Their policy seems to be to cut down on actual materials atm.
22:32 <@Kake> Ah, OK :)  Well, I'll have time next week to have a wander around and see how John Lewis are.
22:32 <@Shevek> I tend to go to a specialist.
22:33 <@Kake> I havewn't actually bought any of this stuff since I lived in Oxford.  It all got packed and I only unpacked it the other week.  I'm running out of supplies now.
22:33 <@Shevek> I've just rebuilt my room in the hope of getting back into it.
22:34 <@Kake> :)
22:34 <@Shevek> Gah, why is my thesis getting shorter?
22:34 <@Kake> You left the lid off and it evaporated.
22:35 <@Kake> Put more diagrams.
22:35 <@Shevek> Yeah, that's always a good one.

02:24 <@richardc> weren't you meant to register before the event?
02:25 <@aaron> I am hacking a python handler for autodia and I have reached the turning point of either hacking all night on it because I have got the basics working or just going to bed and getting into the zone some other time
02:25 <@aaron> richardc: probably
02:25 <@richardc> robin_sz: london.rhizomatic is fine, it's just that the dns that points at it hasn't been changed
02:25 <@yoda> a) i don't believe you have to   b) i did anyway
02:25 <@aaron> yoda: you register how ?
02:25 <@richardc> I read the rules and it seemed you had to register a team
02:25 <@aaron> by subbing ti the list
02:25 <@aaron> ?
02:26 <@yoda> aaron: yep, that's what i did
02:26 <@yoda> [[ All programmers are invited to enter the contest, either individually or in teams ]]
02:27 <@aaron> cool
02:27 <@aaron> might try on sunday and do the 24 hr lightening thing
02:27 <@yoda> and also [[  This year you will run your entry on your own computer, so there is no need to worry whether or not your compiler is correctly installed on ours. ]]
02:27 <@aaron> yoda: nice
02:27 <@aaron> I noticed that
02:27 <@aaron> can you do multiple submissions ?
02:27 <@yoda> esp nice with perl and cpan :)
02:28 <@aaron> yoda: hell yeah
02:28 <@richardc> ' At midnight, GMT, on Saturday 28th June, the programming task will be published on this web site. It will also be sent by email to registered teams [team registration will be possible from 23rd June]. Teams will have 72 hours - Saturday, Sunday, and Monday - to write a program to perform this task, and submit their solution to the judges. There will also be a special lightning division for those who only have 24 hours to spend on the contest. '
02:28 <@aaron> the only deadline it gives is 23:59 sunday tho
02:28 <@aaron> s/sun/mon/
02:29 <@aaron> no 'register by' deadline
02:29 <@aaron> so you have no excuse
02:29 <@aaron> ;)
02:29 <@aaron> is GMT 1 hr behind BST ?
02:29 <@richardc> you know, it's much easier to post links and assume reading comprehension
02:29 <@richardc> aaron: surely for the llightning thing you haqve to submit in the irst 24 hours

02:47 <@Shevek> acme, you know the load on dabox was <147?
02:48 <@Shevek> I mean >147.

02:48 <@acme> Shevek: http://geekflat.org/stats/load.png # i think it was our mailfilters, the secondary MXs kicked in and sent us lots of mail
02:48 <@Shevek> It was muttley's mail filter, which swapped half a gig.
02:48 <@Shevek> I stopped exim before it shat itself.
02:48 <@acme> cor
02:49 <@Shevek> Load average is <1 now, I'm going to restart it.
02:49 <@acme> feel free to bug him about it
02:49 <@Shevek> Muttley's mailfilter uses 13Mb per process, and just spirals.
02:49 <@Shevek> I mailed box list. We'll see if that gets a result.
02:49 <@Shevek> Really, it has to or the kernel vm will start killing processes, and there are certain processes which really shouldn't get killed.
02:51 <@Shevek> Here it goes again.
02:51 <@Shevek> mailfilter is WAY too slow.
02:51 <@bob> exim filters thats the answer
02:51 <@acme> i use something similar. i wonder why his is so slow
02:52 <@Shevek> Slow and big.
02:52 <@Shevek> Shouldn't the ICFP task description be out now?
02:53 <@acme> yeah, it's definitely past 0:00 GMT, but it's not up yet
02:53 <@Shevek> Perhaps they confused GMT with PDT?
02:54 <@yoda> no, it's past 0:00 BST
02:54 <@Shevek> Ahhhhhh
02:54  * Shevek sucks.
02:54 <@yoda> wait 6 minutes
02:54 <@yoda> we had this discussion half an hour ago :)
02:54 <@Shevek> I bet they have a cron job.

02:54 <@yoda> not suprised
02:55 <@Shevek> Is anyone making a team, or are we just hacking randomly?
02:55 <@yoda> don't think anyone's arranged a team (as of yet)

14:19 <@Kake> I did loads of work and had loads of fun and did LGB/environmental stuff as well.  I'm sure I remember sleeping fairly regularly so maybe someone cloned me.
14:19  * aef doesn't really relate much to Joe anyway. I just feel guilty about giving up on that.

14:21 <@mstevens> my final year had a lot of walking out of exams as soon as you were allowed to
14:21 <@Kake> I spent moretime than I should have on usenet.  Thinking about it, I have no idea how this can all have added up.  I was so much more efficient then.

14:24 <@aef> Didn't know that.
14:24 <@Kake> It was during the time with all the ex-husband badness.
14:24 <@aef> Ahh.
14:25 <@aef> I keep forgetting you were married. Seems so unKakelike.
14:25 <@Kake> After I got away from him it was basically "OK, I want a new life now, I didn't like that one", and the PhD felt all tied up with that.
14:25 <@Kake> Why is it unKakelike?
14:26 -!- richardc changed the topic of #london.pm to: BEEEEEEEEES
14:26 <@Kake> bees++ # Waggledance
14:26 <@aef> It just doesn't seem to fit in with the fairly independant/confident Kake I see.
14:26  * mstevens spins on his chair until he gets dizzy
14:26 <@aef> Kake: If you were the shape of a bee you'd dance waggly too.
14:26 <@Kake> I don't see any reason why independence and confidence conflict with marriage.
14:27 <@aef> mstevens: You're avoiding academic work, aren't you?
14:27 <@mstevens> aef: maybe a little
14:27 <@Kake> You just have to make sure you're marrying the right person, which I didn't (and knew all along it was the wrong thing to do for the long run).
14:27 <@aef> Kake: No, but with the sort of marriage you described before.
14:28 <@Kake> aef: He was 11 years older than me, and when we started going out I was just past my 16th birthday.
14:28 <@mstevens> aef: I've been putting it off for a while because its just hit the edge of a-level
14:28 <@Kake> Which now I see as being a little creepy.
14:28  * aef wishes education was cheaper.
14:28 <@aef> Kake: Yeah.
14:29 <@mstevens> aef: OU is pretty cheap, they send you large boxes filled with education every few months
14:29 <@aef> mstevens: But they don't do what I want to do.
14:29 <@Kake> What do you want to do?
14:29 <@mstevens> problem
14:30 <@mstevens> actually they don't do some stuff I'm interested in either
14:30 <@aef> I think I might try do A level bio and chem next year at night school, with a view to do sonmething bio/bioinfish
14:30 <@Kake> Biology is fun.
14:30 <@aef> Kake: Something in biology, or bioinf, or chem, or maybe material sciencs.
14:30 <@mstevens> aef: I still reckon you could probably go straight to a bioinformatics MSc
14:30 <@aef> But a "hard" sci degree of some sort, not a "life sciences" degree.
14:31 <@aef> mstevens: That's one of the options (I'm including MScs as degrees).
14:31 <@mstevens> aef: The course I'm doing has some biology and chemistry components
14:31 <@aef> mstevens: Yes, but I want more of a specialised thing.
14:32 <@aef> But I won't start it next year, anyway, so will do the A levels then, which should also tell me if I might hate it too much :)

14:46 <@Kake> I don't know what it is about wandering around the house dressed in a sheet that makes people threaten to take me clothes shopping.
14:46 <@aef> Hehe.
14:46 <@aef> Toga party?
14:47 <@Kake> I just like my sheet.  It's made of nice material.
14:49 <@ivorw> like Linus? but that was a blanket

14:52 <@Kake> What's the etc?
14:53 <@aef> Shutting the toilet door, nor leaving clothes over the living room.
14:53 <@aef> Must buy a TV, too.

14:59 <@aef> I wasn in Antartica. Weird.
14:59 <@Kake> I need to chuck more stuff out.
14:59 <@mstevens> I need to chuck more stuff out.
14:59 <@aef> (Only spelled right)
14:59 <@mstevens> but first I need to get all my stuff in the same place so I can start filtering.
15:00 <@aef> Ditto. But I need to sort through it first.
15:00 <@aef> I need to get ADSL and a new computer.
15:00 <@yoda> Kake: what sort of stuff do you need to chuck out?
15:01 <@Kake> All the crap that's been following me around in boxes for years.
15:01 <@mstevens> I'm thinking it's maybe time to get rid of all the a) paperwork I've been accumulating for years b) clothes I haven't worn in 5 years, don't like, and don't fit me
15:01  * aef just has _loads_ of bits of paper.
15:01 <@Kake> I moved out of a rather large flat in rather a hurry and had nowhere to put stuff for a few years.
15:02  * aef is tempted to go all Fight Club with is stuff every so often
15:02 <@yoda> i've got lots of that sort of stuff. every time i sort trough it all i decide i need to keep most of it. what if anything i chuck out is outweighed by the amount of new crap i've accumulated since the last time
15:02 <@Kake> I have things like phone bills from 1993.
15:02 <@mstevens> kake: phone bills from 1993 is the higher quality, more useful kind of paper I've got accumulated
15:03 <@Kake> Ah, I've not acquired new crap for some time.
15:03  * aef has lots of unsorted bills, letters, receipts, junk.
15:03 <@aef> And I have a _load_ of stuff I need to shred. Maybe I should go to Argos and buy a shredder today?
15:03 <@mstevens> aef: jfdi
15:03 <@yoda> i have loads of unopened bank statements
15:05  * aef gets a tuit and goes to get up, investigate shredders.

15:37 <@ivorw> Which version?
15:37 <+dipsy> Which version is, like, clearer
15:37 <@yoda> 0.04
15:37 <@ivorw> Odd.. it's a bog standard Makefile.PL with no clever stuff
15:38 <@yoda> looks like it's in the version code in lite.pm
15:38 <@yoda> would pasty it but i can't get c&p to work in the window it's runningin
15:39 <@richardc> yoda: are you running on a very old perl
15:39 <@richardc> since it sounds like a 5.6ism
15:39 <@yoda> 5.005_03
15:40 <@richardc> does the error mention 'our' at all
15:40 <@yoda> yes
15:40 <@richardc> that's your problem
15:40 <@yoda> also mentions not being able to modify subroutine entry in scalar assignment
15:40 <@richardc> you'll need to use a newer version of perl
15:41 <@yoda> this isn't a box i control, so would prefer not to
15:41 <@richardc> since our $VERSION = 'foo'; is a 5.6ism, and 5.5.3 gets confused
15:41 -!- itz_ [~itz@62.3.198.42] has joined #london.pm
15:41 <@yoda> can i modify the source quickly to get it to work on 5.005_03?
15:41 <@ivorw> richardc: can it work with 'use vars' instead of 'our'?
15:42 <@richardc> ivorw: yes.  also check that you have no <open my $fh, "..."> stuff
15:42 <@Shevek> I don't understand why people use 'our' instead of 'use vars'. Is there any advantage at all?
15:43 <@richardc> and instead use IO::File for your lexical filehandle needs
15:43 <@richardc> it's more concise
15:43 <@robin_sz> Shevek: any advantage? of course there is!
15:43 <@ivorw> Ah, richardc has a point. I do use a local filehandle in the module
15:43  * Shevek never uses 'our'
15:43 <@robin_sz> Shevek: its a very useful word when writing Perl poetry, how else where we supposed to het it into the language?
15:44 <@ivorw> If anyone wants to supply a retrofit patch to VCS::Lite, they are welcome
15:44 <@Shevek> I wish there was a really concise way to slurp a file.
15:44 <@Shevek> Can we have a new keyword please?
15:44 <@Shevek> slurp($file)?
15:44 <@robin_sz> hmnm
15:44 <@richardc> our and open my $fh are the most common 5.6isms you see in the wild
15:44 <@muttley> and use warnings;
15:45 <@robin_sz> if only there was some way of extending the language with custom modules, then that could be achieved
15:45 <@richardc> muttley: nobody really uses that
15:45 <@richardc> File::Slurp  
15:45 <@ivorw> shevek: my $contents = do { local (@ARGV,$/) = $filename; <> } ;
15:45 < itz_> what about the ISA replacement as well?
15:45 <@Shevek> Interesting.
15:45 <@muttley> gosh, ikaruga is hard
15:45 <+dipsy> Interesting. is this after more than just a single whiskey nightcap? ;)
15:46 <@richardc> itz_: you mean C<use base> ?
15:46 < itz_> yes
15:46 <@richardc> use base works in 5.00503
15:46 < itz_> does it?
15:46 <+dipsy> Sure it does
15:46 < itz_> oh
15:46 <@richardc> it just doesn't auto-require
15:46 <@richardc> so you see an extra redundant require Foo; before the use base 'Foo';
15:48 <@robin_sz> but ISA is so useful in poetry, I guess it will still be in Perl6, which I have been studiously ignoring for some months now.
15:48 <@richardc> yes and no
15:48 <@robin_sz> yes ... *and* no ..
15:49 <@richardc> it'll still be there because perl6 will be able to run of your old perl5 code
15:49 <@robin_sz> uh huh.
15:49 <@richardc> but for perl6 inheritance, you specify parentage differently
15:49 <@robin_sz> okie.
15:50 <@robin_sz> I know people have asked this before, but does it run yet?
15:50 <@richardc> does what run?
15:50 <@richardc> and run what?
15:50 <+dipsy> RUN AWAY!!!!
15:51 <@robin_sz> perl 6 ....or is it still theory and RFC's ?
15:51 <@robin_sz> I know parrot sort of runs
15:51 <@ivorw> it flutters
15:51 <@richardc> there's a mini perl6 interpreter (or maybe compiler) that's part of parrot, but since the language spec isn't finished it's not really perl6
15:51 <@richardc> and it's not hugely functional
15:52 <@robin_sz> so its still 'some way off' then.
15:53 <@richardc> yes, buy the book and you can find all this out and more
15:53 <@robin_sz> its made it over the event horizon, but its too far in the distance to be able to predict when it might arrive?
15:54 < itz_> prediction of open source project completition dates is problematic look at the linux kernel releases
15:54 <@richardc> I'm sure you could predict its arrival, but I'm also certain that I couldn't with any degree of certainty
15:54  * robin_sz nods.
15:55 <@robin_sz> itz_: thats not hard at all, I can make kernel predictions very easily
15:55 <@robin_sz> itz_: I predict there will be a new kernel release within a week.
15:55 <@robin_sz> there you go.
15:55 <@richardc> 2 years still sounds right, but I'm still unwilling to say when the 2 years starts :)
15:56 < itz_> I meant stable release
15:56 <@robin_sz> heh,
15:56 <@robin_sz> stable? ... 
15:56 <@richardc> well you just got 2.4.21 damnit
15:56 <@robin_sz> we never seem to be stable
15:56 <@richardc> or are you just poking at the 'software is never stable' button
15:56 < itz_> OK next major even number release
15:57 < itz_> 2.6 should be out by now but isn't
15:57 <@richardc> or the 'bsd is stable, unlike those funny finnish kids'
15:57 <@robin_sz> ahh thats more difficult.
15:57 <@robin_sz> and it will be 2.6 ... eep
15:57 <@robin_sz> bsd stable is quite stable.#
15:58 <@robin_sz> isn't 2.6 the one with real threads and much heartache?
15:58 <@richardc> yeah, but it doesn't actually do anything
15:58 <@ivorw> software is bolting the stable door after the horse has already done so ;)
15:58 <@richardc> right, off to see the qulaity motion picture that is 2f2f
15:58 < itz_> I think we can safely predict that perl 6 will be out "later than expected"
15:58 <@robin_sz> thats not *quite* true ... RH have tried to implemnt threading in RH9 and it does do something.
15:58 <@richardc> itz_: even if you expect it never to be released?
15:58 <@robin_sz> it makes things ! work
15:59 < itz_> OK "later than claimed"
15:59 <@richardc> robin_sz: I mean the bsd kernels don't do anything
15:59  * richardc & # brane off, fast cars
15:59 < itz_> robin_sz: linux has had pthreads for some time
16:00 <@robin_sz> itz_: true, and I amconfused a bit what the new threading stuff is tbh.
16:00 <@ivorw> dipsy, karma pthreads
16:00 <+dipsy> pthreads has neutral karma
16:01 <@ivorw> I first encountered pthreads on VMS, where they turned out really useful
16:01 < itz_> and its had clone() for years too
16:01 <@Shevek> Who is doing ICFP?
16:02 <@robin_sz> ISTR acam was
16:02 <@robin_sz> acme even
16:02  * Shevek is going to winz0r and beatz0r acm3. *grin*
16:02 <@robin_sz> url of competition?
16:02 <@acme> nah, i'm not
16:03 <@acme> how are you doing?
16:03 < itz_> I think 2.6 will have NPTL
16:03 < itz_> does anyone *really* understand threads anyway :)
16:04  * robin_sz downloads parrot 0.0.10
16:04 <@robin_sz> sometimes I think I do
16:04 <@robin_sz> I have some multithreaded java foo ... it works fine, but its more luck than judgement
16:04 <@ivorw> itz - I had to, for work a few jobs ago
16:05 <@acme> robin_sz: parrot has changed a lot recently, i recommend getting the cvs version
16:05 <@Shevek> I've got a really nice model implementation, and I think I've designed my algorithm now. I'm using a really, really simple AI algorithm which distributes, and if I get really bored, I might go run it on a few hundred hosts at the uni, or something.
16:05 <@ivorw> That was low level programming in C though
16:05 <@acme> cool
16:05 <@Shevek> I'm going to do genetic code.
16:06 <@Shevek> Which means I can distribute the population.
16:06 <@acme> this is exactly the type of problem you'd want to have access to lots of boxes for
16:06 <@ivorw> sounds fun
16:06 <@robin_sz> acme: its my first peek at it, it will change a lot more before Perl 6 is out .. I suspect 0.0.10 will be enough to get a flavour ... and is more likely to compile than the CVS maybe?
16:06 <@Shevek> It depends if the uni is open on sunday
16:06 < itz_> ivorw: OK summerise the difference between open source unix thread implementions compared to, say, solaris in one line of IRC :)
16:06 <@Shevek> open source sucks. solaris blows.
16:06 <@Shevek> do I get the job for that?
16:07 < itz_> no its not a constructive answer (although prolly accurate)
16:08  * Shevek has computed an algorithm for breeding two drivers to make a better driver.
16:09 <@Shevek> OK. Perhaps cantilever shelves _weren't_ meant to take that weight.
16:10 <@ivorw> It's in the way the OS implements shared memory, and how well that has been implemented. Also the concept of a 'process' and a 'thread', how much is shared etc.
16:10 <@Quidity> And that linux sucks.
16:10 <@robin_sz> ahh. shared memory. that can be so fun
16:11 <@robin_sz> ive been looking at some realtime stuff in linux, sharing memory between realtime and nonrealtime bit of the system is fun.
16:12 <@ivorw> sounds like persistence

12:10 < rataxis> imo religion is bad, but i'll leave other people alone to do it. evangelism and religious recruiting at the best of times makes me angry
12:10 < rataxis> but a whole friends page of it?
12:10 < rataxis> ffs
12:10  * rataxis gets a little perspective...
12:10 < rataxis> ;)
12:11 <@Kake> Well, he did go to Japan specifically to do missionary work.
12:12 <@DrHyde> now that *is* weird
12:12 < rataxis> he did?
12:12 < rataxis> that's it
12:12 <@Kake> Yes.
12:12 < rataxis> i'm taking him off my friends list
12:12 < rataxis> weirdo.
12:12 < rataxis> evangelical xians--
12:12 <@Kake> I'm sure he'll be heartbroken.
12:12 < rataxis> pfft

12:14 < rataxis> Kake: it's not the missionary work i care about, so much as the 1000s of words about it.
12:15 <@Kake> That thing about the woman who has to maintain her family's Buddhist altar yet wants to become a Christian is interesting.
12:16 <@Kake> Well, it's several days of entries all appearing at once.  I don't think he has great connectivity at the moment.
12:16 <@DrHyde> missionaries are Just Wrong, the buggers just interfere in local cultures and break shit.  I have a cousin who went missionarying in Peru, and I don't think I've spoken to her since :-)
12:16 < rataxis> DrHyde++ # in fact, that's exactly what I felt, but didn't want to offend.
12:16 < rataxis> fuck it, you're absolutely right.
12:17 <@Kake> Generalisations are bad.
12:17 < rataxis> (cue argument about whether japan counts as a culture that'd be easy to break)
12:17 <@Kake> From what I understand, all he's doing is being there for people who are curious.  I've known him for gosh nearly 8 years now, it must be, and he's *never* tried to evangelise me.
12:18 <@DrHyde> Kake: yes, that's what missionaries are trained to say
12:19 < rataxis> heh
12:19 <@Kake> Oh come on.  We're talking about Simon here.  You *can't* make him say stuff.  You just can't.
12:19  * DrHyde notes that lathos did warn people that he'd be going all weird, and suggested that they pay no attention to his blog
12:19 < rataxis> thing is, i've never ever heard him mention religion online
12:19 < rataxis> i've never emt him offline
12:19 < rataxis> *met
12:19 < rataxis> so this just seemed awfully out of character
12:19 <@Kake> Seems a bit dumb to be deciding what's out of character for someone you don't even know.
12:20 <@DrHyde> maybe he's a guerilla missionary, sent by his church elders (or whatever they're called) to infiltrate and spy on the heathen perl mongers :-)
12:20 < rataxis> Kake : erm
12:20 < rataxis> Kake: well it's based on my observations, what else can I base on?

12:20  * rataxis rolls his eyes.
12:21 < rataxis> where else does he post it, then?
12:21 <@Kake> You said you read it on livejournal - I read it on blog.simon-cozens.org
12:22 < rataxis> oh, right, spose he pushes it across
12:22 < rataxis> he has lj user=lathos
12:22 <@Kake> It's one of those RSS syndication thingies, like bob and davorg's livejournals.

12:30 <@acme> and cranberry juice
12:30 <+dipsy> cranberry juice is a great mixer with vodka
12:31 <@DrHyde> i haven't tried the litre stein i stole from the hofbrauhaus yet.  not with tea anyway.  london pride goes in it most excellently.
12:31 <@Kake> I have a litre stein of water right here; thought it might be a useful thing to take to bed last night after the pub.

12:44 <@alex> ok

21:50 <@DrHyde> Kai: ask on the list, i know there's a couple
21:51 <@DrHyde> droogs: of course you've got bad credit, you are single-handedly responsible for the death of thirty seven dotcoms
21:51 <@DrHyde> :-)
21:51 <@droogs> hey
21:51  * droogs slaps DrHyde
21:51 <@Kai> cambridge types? Who are they? Not magsy :)
21:51 <@DrHyde> ouch!
21:51  * Kai is going to Debconf in Norway. Wondering whose comin'
21:52 <@droogs> norway?
21:52 <+dipsy> it has been said that norway is so cold!
21:52  * desnarf argghs plaintively at java 1.1.8
21:52 <@DrHyde> not aware of anyone going from nodnol
21:52 <@desnarf> why you so petit
21:52 <@Kai> droogs: indeed
21:52 <@droogs> desnarf: 1.1.8 - is that the java that ships with debian woody ?
21:52 <@Kai> anyone tried Id's free game Enemy Territory?
21:52 <@droogs> you need at least 1.2.x to do anything useful
21:53 <@desnarf> i dunno, droogs 
21:53 <@droogs> o2-- # website really slow
21:53 <@desnarf> it's the one which PersonalJava pretty much implements
21:53 <@_Dave> what do we think of the perl version that ships with OS X?
21:53 <@Elthek> Kai: Helix is going.
21:54 <@richardc> _Dave: it sucks.  install 5.8.0 in /usr/local
21:54 <@DrHyde> _Dave: we think it's a bit old
21:54 <@Elthek> 1.1.8 is from.. 1997?
21:54 <@Elthek> Or 1996.  1.1.9 was 1997.
21:55 <@Elthek> We think it's a brokenbroken perl and they should at least have gone to 5.6.1 but that's brokenbroken too and there's no reason not to use 5.8.0 apart from binary incompatibility but no-one cares about that.
21:55  * desnarf accelerates to 88mph
21:55 <@_Dave> is there a finkish way of upgrading?
21:56 <@Kai> Elthek: I don't think I know him. URL?
21:56  * _Dave wants to KISS if at all possible
21:56 <@Elthek> Kai: http://people.debian.org/~mjg59/
21:56 <@Elthek> He's been to social meets.
21:57 <@richardc> the way to keep it simple is to ssh to another box with a nice install of perl-maint
21:58 <@Kake> Has he been to more than one?  I thought he came to one, stole our women, and went away again.
21:58 <@DrHyde> Kai: you're thinking of conan the barbarian
21:59 <@DrHyde> errm, kake rather
21:59 <@Kake> Helix is kind of like the opposite of Conan the barbarian.
21:59 <@Kai> I am going to turn off this computer and read some HP

13:58 <@vorsprung> TeeJay, well I'm only on the outside.  I interviewed there a couple of times and I know a couple of people that work there in sales
13:58 <@TeeJay> I think the advertising is to placate the 2 developers they have left
13:58 <@TeeJay> I worked there :)
13:59 <@vorsprung> TeeJay, ah, i used to run netgates
13:59 <@TeeJay> netgates ?
13:59  * DrHyde wonders what proportion of a salary they've spent on advertising
13:59 <@vorsprung> TeeJay, heh a crappy small time ISP, had a internet cafe in broad street
13:59 <@TeeJay> DrHyde: none - its all thru agencies and they don't pay til they hire somebody
14:00 <@TeeJay> vorsprung: oh
14:01 <@vorsprung> TeeJay, when I was there they had all the bristol evening post web serving + a thriving web design unit + dial up + 3000 email boxes
14:01 <@vorsprung> TeeJay, i quit though as I thought they were about to go bust and I was fed up with the commute to bristol
14:04 <@TeeJay> heh
14:04 <@TeeJay> fair enough
14:04 <@vorsprung> TeeJay, so where do you live? I'm in devon
14:04 -!- TeeJay changed the topic of #london.pm to: nothing that can't be fixed with a short, sharp letterbomb campaign
14:04 <@TeeJay> devon?
14:04 <@TeeJay> eep!
14:05 <@TeeJay> that is a hell of a commute
14:05 <@vorsprung> yeah near tiverton
14:05 <@TeeJay> I commuted there from wilts
14:05 <@vorsprung> nah it was fine when the trains worked
14:05 <@vorsprung> I cycle to the station, 45 minute journey, 10 minute walk from the station
14:05 <@vorsprung> then the trains went to shite
14:06 <@davorg> oh good. purlgurl is being instulting to me and nms again

14:08 <@Nicholas> davorg: should I mention jobs.perl.org on list in reply to this agent?
14:08 <@davorg> Nicholas: i've already mentioned it to him
14:10 <@vorsprung> purlgurl isn't for real though
14:10 <@vorsprung> it's just a silly joke
14:10  * kaneX read that post
14:10 <@TeeJay> gah! she is so annoying
14:10 <@davorg> i'm still wavering on that. i'm not convinced either way
14:10 <@kaneX> it's amazing to see an ego bigger than randal's
14:11 <@TeeJay> but randal isn't a total twat
14:11 <@davorg> notice that she says "I am stating I am the best known Perl programmer anywhere." :)
14:11 <@kaneX> purlgurl > randal in this case
14:11 <@DrHyde> talking of which, anyone who's not on the naughty list want to review his book?
14:11 <@DrHyde> mail me if you do
14:11 <@gellyfish> god that idiot still around
14:11 <@kaneX> i had never heard of her until someone posted a link to the code
14:11 <@gellyfish> I remember why I gave up on clpm
14:11 <@davorg> DrHyde: randal's new book? yes please.
14:11 <@kaneX> i used it as a 'how not to program' tutorial at $work
14:12 <@DrHyde> davorg: mail me, cos that way it goes into my to-do list
14:12 <@davorg> 'k
14:12 <@DrHyde> and the perl6 book?
14:12 <@Ranguard> Anyone know of a good module for very basic web->db add / view / delete thing ?
14:12 <@TeeJay> Ranguard: I am thinking of writing one
14:12 <@TeeJay> let me know if you find one
14:13 <@Ranguard> TeeJay: I've got a dodgy script U just specify the fields in and it does the rest but you always need to hack in little things and it's just nasty :)
14:13 <@Kai> What proggie does one use to calculate checksums in linux again?
14:13 <@richardc> md5sum
14:14 <@richardc> which you can do again and again and again
14:14 <@TeeJay> Ranguard: cool - can you mail me and remind me
14:14  * TeeJay plans codia to build basic web apps from dia or xml
14:15 <@TeeJay> s/web/db/
14:15 <@richardc> TeeJay: before you do that, plit your thing that requires inline::jaja out from the main autodia dist.  I just tried to install it and got fucking annoyed
14:16 <@gellyfish> plit!
14:17 <@TeeJay> richardc: could just make it an optional thing in the makefile
14:17 <@TeeJay> would that help ?
14:17 <@claes> gellyfish : are you comming to YAPC::EU this year?
14:17 <@gellyfish> claes, no I'm not
14:17 <@claes> =Å(
14:17 <@richardc> TeeJay: then that makes it an interactive makefile, so no
14:18 <@TeeJay> richardc: bah
14:18 <@TeeJay> it doesn't break tho' it just moans a bit
14:18 <@TeeJay> surely thats correct
14:19 <@TeeJay> no pleasing some people
14:19 <@richardc> no.  the cpan shell will go no further
14:19 <@TeeJay> really ?
14:19 <+dipsy> really is going offline now
14:19 <@TeeJay> damn
14:19 <@richardc> because it doesn't have the dependency
14:19 <@TeeJay> I see
14:19 <@richardc> split the dist.  it's a free step up the leaderboard
14:19  * TeeJay ought to fix that then
14:19 <@TeeJay> good idea
14:20  * TeeJay is tempted to just drop java for now
14:20 <@TeeJay> esp as java 1.4 breaks inline and reflection
14:20 <@TeeJay> none of the java users bother emailing me either
14:20 <@TeeJay> if they really cared they would email me patches and congratulations
14:20 <@TeeJay> and stuff
14:21 <@TeeJay> the c++ users seem particularly interested (and grateful) for it
14:21 <@TeeJay> they send lots of patches and stuff, even their header files
14:21 <@richardc> apart from they're probably finding that they can't install the fucking thing, thus having no motivation
14:22 <@TeeJay> everybody else manages (i.e. the c++ users, php peeps and even python people)
14:23 <@richardc> no, they don't
14:23 <@TeeJay> okay some people had trouble because I mis-spelt cpan in the INSTALL file
14:23 <@richardc> I'm a perl person, and the thing is written in perl, and I have narrowly fought it onto my system
14:23 <@TeeJay> sorry
14:23 <@TeeJay> I will have to play with it some more
14:23 <@Nicholas> mmm. sitf no agencies http://jobs.perl.org/job/673
14:24 <@TeeJay> splitting the INLINE::Java out will probably happen this version if its causing that much trouble
14:24 <@TeeJay> along with adding an experimental python parser
14:24 <@claes> autodia?
14:25 <+dipsy> autodia is probably Automagic Dia UML from source code - http://droogs.org/autodia/
14:25 -!- Nicholas [nick@mirth.demon.co.uk] has left #london.pm []
14:26 <@TeeJay> claes: does sql/dbi and graphviz too
14:26 <@claes> sweeeeet
14:27  * DrHyde still doesn't actually understand what it does :-)
14:27 <@TeeJay> richardc: what did you want GraphViz::DBI to do ? I am maintainer of it now
14:27 <@claes> TeeJay : know if there is a MacOS X port of Dia that doesn't use GNOME?
14:27 <@TeeJay> claes: no - use autodia with graphviz if you don't have dia
14:27 <@richardc> TeeJay: I wanted it to work with postgres.  Autodia doesn't work with it either
14:27 <@TeeJay> should be reasonably helpful then
14:27 <@TeeJay> oh right
14:27 <@TeeJay> ol
14:27 <@TeeJay> will look into it
14:28 <@TeeJay> have you reported it as a bug via rt ?
14:28 <@TeeJay> or email me about it and I will look into it

14:29 <@claes> it would be nice if autodia could output files for OmniGraffle
14:29 <@TeeJay> claes: give me an OmniGraffe file and I will try and reverse engineer it
14:29 <@TeeJay> assuming it is halfway sane
14:30 <@richardc> it seems to be having trouble mixing the studlycaps
14:30 <@claes> TeeJay  is the output backen for autodia pluggable?
14:30 <@claes> s/backen/back-end
14:31 <@TeeJay> claes: er... ish
14:31 <@TeeJay> you can add a replacement layout/output function but have to hack some code to integrate it

14:35 -!- vorsprun1 is now known as vorsprung
14:36 <@richardc> TeeJay: I can tell you exactly what the issue is, if you like
14:37 <@richardc> postgres maps unquoted things down to lowercase, and then compares it against the relation names, which are mixed case.
14:38 <@richardc> so if you want to use a relation which has mixed case, you have to address it in double quotes and get the case exactly right
14:38 <@muttley> (pizza hut)-- # why is there NO FUCKING MENU on your web site. Morons
14:38 <@DrHyde> there is, but you have to dig around for it
14:38 <@DrHyde> and it moooooooves every couple of months
14:38 <@DrHyde> moooooo!!!
14:38 <@richardc> so you have to fuck about with select * from "MyTable"
14:38 <@TeeJay> claes: it sounds even worse than argouml and that really sucked
14:39 <@TeeJay> richardc: ah I see
14:39 <@TeeJay> I could add a check to see if it is dealing with postgres or not
14:39 <@TeeJay> and then escape mixed case table names
14:39 <@claes> does anyone actually use UML?
14:39 <@richardc> both autodia and graphviz::dbi both need that fixing
14:39 <@TeeJay> can you mail at teejay@droogs.org
14:39 <@TeeJay> will fix both
14:39 < vorsprung> claes, have done in the past
14:39 <@richardc> mail yourself, slacker
14:39 <@TeeJay> I use it a little
14:40 <@TeeJay> bah
14:40 <@claes> is it any good, or is it just that executives and fancy people likes the concept of "modeling"?
14:41 <@claes> isn't it better to create the model after the application has been built?
14:41 < vorsprung> claes, it's like any other tool.  It can be used or abused
14:41 <@claes> models usually change during implementation
14:41 < vorsprung> claes, read "agile modelling" by scott ambler
14:41 <@muttley> DrHyde: really? I've tried every option on their web site and I can't find it :(
14:41  * claes remembers a funny thing sky said about UML years ago
14:42 < vorsprung> claes, basically to summarise the whole book in a few sentences he talks about the massive overheads in maintaining a set of related models through a development process and then looks at ways to maintain only a minimal set of models
14:43 <@claes> sounds interesting
14:43  * TeeJay mails himself

14:43 <@TeeJay> cheers richardc
14:43 < vorsprung> claes, so if you and another couple of people are all working on some related classes and want to discuss them as models thenyou might draw diagrams of the relevant bits on a white board, take a photo and then keep them in a jpg
14:44 < vorsprung> claes, then if next week one of you is away you can look at the diagrams.  That's a nice appropriate use of modelling
14:45 < vorsprung> claes, unified process insists on keeping a full set of diagrams describing dozens of different perspectives through a lifecycle.  That's an inappropriate use of modelling
14:46 <@TeeJay> you know you can get interactive white boards that store your original presentation and anything you scribble on it ?
14:46 <@TeeJay> my dad uses them for lecturing about lecturing
14:46 <@TeeJay> they only cost a few hundred quid
14:46 < vorsprung> claes, in scott amblers book he discusses stuff like how to decide which models to keep up to date
14:46  * TeeJay likes the idea of UML diffs - showing code differences in diagrams
14:47 < vorsprung> TeeJay, or "refinements"
14:47 < vorsprung> uml diagram A + refinement B = uml diagram C
14:48 <@TeeJay> vorsprung: yeah - a nice visual way of showing differences in a group on modules / classes over time
14:48 <@TeeJay> that would quickly highlight api changes
14:48 < vorsprung> TeeJay, a tool to show that would be useful if you kept the diagrams in a revision control
14:48 <@TeeJay> very useful I reckon
14:48 < vorsprung> TeeJay, is there such a tool?
14:49 <@TeeJay> vorsprung: nah - generate the diagrams from diffs
14:49  * TeeJay plans to add some RCS / CVS interactions to Autodia
14:49 <@TeeJay> vorsprung: not that I know of
14:49 <@TeeJay> it would be a killer feature for autodia
14:49 <@richardc> gah.  dia sucks ass

14:51 <+dipsy> okay, TeeJay.
14:52 <@TeeJay> dipsy: forget it
14:52 <+dipsy> TeeJay: I forgot it
14:52 <@richardc> I just want to model my database, but the zaglines bite
14:52 <@TeeJay> richardc: use graphviz ?
14:52 < vorsprung> richardc, zaglines?
14:53 <@TeeJay> dia would be so much better if the lines were 'smart'
14:53 <@TeeJay> there is a plan to add auto-layout eventually based on the VCG code but that is fairly distant
14:53 <@richardc> the probalem is, this database has no sane naming scheme
14:53 <@TeeJay> richardc: that would be problematic
14:53 <@richardc> so graphviz::dbi is of no use
14:53 <@TeeJay> hmm
14:54 <@TeeJay> autodia has a graphviz mode but works similar to graphviz::dbi
14:54 <@richardc> and though I could subclass it, by the time I'm done with it, then I've written the relations out in code
14:54 < vorsprung> richardc, convert the names to md5 strings, generate diagram, convert back ;)
14:54 <@DrHyde> impose a sane naming scheme with views?
14:55 <@richardc> DrHyde: bwahahaha
14:55 <@DrHyde> (assuming this isn't mysql)
14:55 <@TeeJay> richardc-- # wants the moon on a db-schema-shaped stick
14:55 <@richardc> part of the problem is I don't know what a sane naming scheme it
14:55 <@richardc> s/it/is/
14:55 <@DrHyde> ah, yes, i can see why that might be a bit of a bummer
14:55 < vorsprung> richardc, yeah or you wouldn't be drawing the diagram in the first place
14:56 <@richardc> that's why I've turned it into a diagram.  I'm running lots of little queries and drawing in lines
14:56 <@TeeJay> Tablename_Column_Name tends to work ;)
14:56 <@DrHyde> for foreign whatsits, yes
14:56 <@TeeJay> was gv:dbi or autodia any use at all ?
14:56 <@richardc> so dia is helping a little, in that I'm not having to draw the lines by hand.  but apart from that it's just shite
14:57 <@DrHyde> although then you end up with names like archive_indialled_callsinprogress.cleardown_location
14:57 <@DrHyde> which is nasty
14:57 <@TeeJay> DrHyde: no use tablename_foreigntable_column_name
14:57 <@richardc> TeeJay: it generated me an initial table, once I'd hacked the module
14:57 <@richardc> s/table/dia file/
14:57 <@TeeJay> richardc: if you can think of any more improvements let me know
14:57 <@richardc> but generally, no
14:57 <@TeeJay> drat

19:02 <@Elthek> So, uh, what debian release are people using on sort-of-production machines these days?  stable seems too old.
19:02 <@DrHyde> stable seems just fine
19:02 <@Elthek> Fair enough.
19:02 <+dipsy> Yeah
19:03 <@chrisa> what do you find 'too old' about stable + security-bits?
19:03 <@mstevens> elthek: stable seems, err, stable. But my needs are simple.
19:03 <@DrHyde> i'm using 2.2/stable (well, mostly stable)
19:03 <@DrHyde> it works, it is sufficiently secure, and i don't trust dist-upgrade quite enough to turn it loose on my mail server :_)
19:04 <@mstevens> elthek: this is personal production machines, work production machines need to be supported for various things which are only supported on redhat, and this avoid the issue entirely.
19:04 <@PerfDave> Well, if uptime is everything, go stable.
19:04 <@PerfDave> If not, don't.
19:04 <@DrHyde> uptime isn't everything, receiving and delivering mail reliably is (at least for me)
19:04 <@PerfDave> FWIW, I run my desktops on testing and my servers on stable
19:05 <@PerfDave> Although I might dist-upgrade a desktop to unstable just to have a look
19:05  * Dom2 runs his servers on -CURRENT :)
19:05 <@DrHyde> the new server that i've been threatening to switch over to for the past year has 3.0/stable on it
19:05  * mstevens has concluded he's getting ripped off for kochi.etla.org, but not decided what to do about it yet.

19:05 <@aef> Steve/Steven
19:06 <@PerfDave> Doesn't ring a bell... should I?
19:06 <@Elthek> Uptime isn't everything, and it'll be used as a desktop.
19:06 <@Elthek> Which made me think stable might suck.
19:06 <@PerfDave> Stable's OK for a desktop. Depends what you want. I'm happy with KDE2.
19:06 <@PerfDave> And it's not like you can't backport packages, which keeps your central libraries on stable, and your less important desktop applications looking pretty and shiny
19:10 <@Dom2> PerfDave: You keep your back port out of this discussion!
19:11 <@aef> PerfDave: He's a Perl person in Oxford, is all.

22:25 <@yoda> it's remarkable how quick the credit limit is reached
22:25 <@mstevens> fanf: my current problem is that I have reasonable supplies of money, but it is all safely locked away in bank accounts. As I have lost my card, I am currently unable to access said bank accounts without 10 minutes in person trying to convince barclays that I'm really me, honest.
22:26 <@yoda> transfer to a different account via phone or internet?
22:26 <@fanf2> get a better bank and a card :-)
22:27 <@mstevens> yoda: I can't do phone banking, because it's based on the card, which is currently invalid because its been cancelled.

Overall: 185
15:51 <@hex> if it's easy wiki'ing you want, these days I recommend OddMuse
15:51 <@hex> yikes, loud karma
15:51 <@davorg> that was Greg
15:51 <@davorg> he got upset when my cat ran away
15:51 <@Kake> I would really like to be able to see previous versions and diffs on londongeek.  Also change comments would be lovely.

15:52 <@claes> I don't like www.
15:52 <@PerfDave> But then, wikis are wrong anyway :)
15:52 <@mstevens> kake: if only someone had written a wiki which provided these features, and made it freely available
15:52 <@davorg> PerfDave: what a boring world it would be if we all thought the same way :)
15:52 <@hex> claes++ # also
15:52 <@PerfDave> davorg: CONFORM CONSUME OBEY
15:52 <@Kake> mstevens: If only.  Though I am trying to motivate myself to reinvent the wheel in a Kwiki shape, just because it would be nice to have it working.
15:52 <@davorg> is there an easy upgrade path from CGI::Kwiki to CGI::Wiki?
15:53 <@Kake> Not yet, but there will be.
15:53 <@claes> www. is reentrant, if you are typing a URL in a web-browser, you fsckin are expecting a www page
15:53 <@davorg> if there is, i'll change
15:53 <@mstevens> kake: I'm trying to motivate myself to work on my search.cpan clone
15:53 <@davorg> claes++
15:53 <@hex> "www" is redundant. You're using HTTP, by default it's going to be a website, shurely?
15:53  * hex blinks
15:53 <@Kake> Give me a few hours to become unemployed, and then wonderful code will appear :)
15:53 <@adam> hex: or a web service
15:53 <+dipsy> a web service is so 2002
15:53 <@adam> =)
15:53 <@hex> LOL
15:53  * mstevens doesn't mind if you use 'www' or not, the bit that bothers me is when a website requires the www. then people quote the url in adverts without it
15:53 <@hex> adam: but, yes.
15:53 <@adam> I'm *soooo* last year, dahrling
15:53 <@richardc> wheel wheels everywhere, and not a drop to drink
15:53 <@hex> mstevens: absolutely
15:54 <@adam> the www certainly isn't required, but it has become something of a convention to have it working
15:54 <@davorg> Kake: and if there was some unemployed expert that I could pay to do the upgrade for me, then that would be wonderful :)
15:55 <@Kake> Oh, gosh, no, don't need to be paid to do wiki stuff.
15:55 <@Kake> (I am never going to be rich, am I?)
15:55 <@davorg> if you're unemployed then I insist.
15:55 <@mstevens> kake, hex: on my screen, on openguides, I can only see the difference in colour between links and body text if I stick my nose about 3cm from the screen and squint.
15:55 <@Kake> Well, OK, let's talk about it in the pub.
15:56 <@adam> Kake: you've refused once, that's enough to be polite
15:56 <@davorg> Kake++ # business negotiations in the pub
15:56 <@adam> Kake: take the nice man's money
15:56 <@hex> mstevens: I've noticed that on my laptop here as well; but doesn't the underlining suggest links?
15:56 <@mstevens> hex: that's another thing...
15:56 <@hex> I can force underlines with the stylesheet if that would help.
15:56 <@PerfDave> People working for free on things they want to be good is why propriatery software is in many ways doomed. Unfortunatley it involves things like RedHat and wiki and other evil, but that's the downside of the model.
15:57 <@mstevens> hex: possibly it's because I'm using a moz release candidate, but my web browser doesn't seem to ever underline links
15:57 <@mstevens> in fact, that reminds me, 1.4final exists now

16:00 <@hex> PerfDave: *bzzt* nope, part of the Way of Wiki is that there is no Ein Wiki. Try harder.
16:00 <@PerfDave> They're all Wiki though.
16:00 <@mstevens> hex: no change, but 1.4final has downloaded, installing

16:02 <@hex> PerfDave: bollocks they do, they prefer Lotus Notes
16:02 <@PerfDave> Well, Lotus Notes is *also* Just Plain Wrong

16:04 <@PerfDave> Magnus: Anything that helps you locate pussy, eh? ;)
16:04 <@Magnus> lol
16:04 <@mstevens> hex: hmm, I get underlines with 1.2, but not with 1.4. very weird.
16:04 <@davorg> Spike stayed with Greg when gill and I went to Edinburgh one year
16:04 <@hex> mstevens: very!
16:04 <@davorg> you'd have to ask him what he liked so much
16:04 <@mstevens> hex: probably my problem though, as I get the same behaviour with google
16:05 <@davorg> oh. it's a new month isn't it?

16:09 <@Magnus> what's wrong with POP
16:09  * DrHyde doesn't understand, how else does one deliver mail?
16:09 <@robin_sz> Magnus: pop? whats that?
16:09 <@Magnus> POP3
16:09 <@richardc> DrHyde: carrier pigeon
16:09 <@davorg> it's a kind of drink
16:09 <@Magnus> it's how normal people retrieve their mail
16:09 <@davorg> it's how _end users_ retreive their mail
16:10 <@robin_sz> no, its a method for users to get mail out of a mailbox
16:10 <@Magnus> how is that different to what I said
16:10  * robin_sz nods at davorg
16:10 <@DrHyde> Magnus: take your dictionary, and look up "deliver".  Now look up "retrieve".  Admire how different they are.
16:10 <@davorg> end users aren't people
16:10 <@robin_sz> Magnus: it is *NOT* mail transport protocol between MTA's
16:11 <@Magnus> robin_sz: sure.
16:11 <@Kake> robin_sz: hippo birdy
16:11 <@robin_sz> pop3 is host->user. smtp is host-host

16:11 <@davorg> robin_sz: you old git now?

16:15 <@richardc> I use them as raw ip providers, pretty much always have
16:15 <@PerfDave> That's all I use Pipex for
16:15 <@robin_sz> and Mailbox will coordinate the ISDN removal/ADSL provision which demon wont do.
16:16 <@robin_sz> demon connectivity is excellent usually .. I would have stayed regardless of the smtp fuck up, if they could have changed me over without a 10 day break in service
16:16 <@robin_sz> sorry .. I'm whinging again.
16:17 <@richardc> what's that noise?  anyone else hear that?

16:25 <+CPAN> richardc: http://search.cpan.org/author/RCLAMP/Mariachi-0.31/
16:25 <@richardc> mmm, that's stale
16:25 <@robin_sz> Magnus: the big difference between POP3 and SMTP is you lose the SMTP envelope that tells you who it was actually delivered to. you should not rely on From: lines for mail routing.
16:25 <@robin_sz> or To: even
16:26 <@richardc> 0.41 is actually on cpan
16:26 <@richardc> http://search.cpan.org/author/RCLAMP/Mariachi/
16:27 <@Magnus> robin_sz: sure
16:27  * robin_sz wonders what to 'gussy up' might be
16:27 <@richardc> to make pretty
16:27 <@yoda> robin_sz: although i use smtp for this purpose, i can retrieve my emails via pop/imap and they add a header to each message to give the original destination information
16:28 <@robin_sz> yoda: that is possible to do, sure. but what about rejecting mails based on smtp exchange rather than delivering them?
16:29 <@robin_sz> eg my sendmail rejects *everything* from .kr .cn and .ru without even seeing the headers
16:30 <@yoda> robin_sz: i can do that on the hosting side with filtering if i really want to
16:30 <@robin_sz> sure ... but i *am* the hosting side ...
16:31 <@robin_sz> yoda: so when I only get ot by POP3 not SMTP .. im stuffed
16:31 <@yoda> robin_sz: good point :)
16:31 <@robin_sz> yoda: which is why I am leaving demon and why Magnus's 'why not use POP3' was not really a solution :)
16:32 <@richardc> robin_sz: but you can get it over adsl, which means at least you're only stuffed for a short amount of time
16:32  * CPAN upload: WWW-SearchBroker-0.05 by NATE
16:32 <@robin_sz> richardc: true, but the added pain of the demon ISDN->ADSL conversion process over Mailbox is no longer worth the effort
16:33 <@richardc> okay.  shall we all repeast ourselves two more times, then head home for the day?
16:33 <@yoda> only two more times?

16:55 <@gellyfish> If you look at the 5.8.0 source you will see a hints file that causes it to use gdbm instead if it is available
16:56 <@gellyfish> you may need to rebuild NDBM_File

17:09 < rataxis> hex: perhaps they're putting the cash towards their armed forces? :o
17:10 <@hex> Heh.
17:10 <@davorg> why do you need a french visa?
17:10 < rataxis> DrHyde : we take rohypnol / just to get it on / boy yoo shore doo have a purty ayuss
17:10 <@DrHyde> hex: might i suggest taking a look at icstis's rules and regulations and seeing if you can provoke an international incident?  I don't *think* they're allowed to make you queue.
17:10 <@hex> davorg: I don't, my wife does...

17:13 <@TeeJay> now shutting down the french visa line because it broke rules *is* funny
17:13 <@Kake> noidd: The search needs redoing a little - the CGI::Wiki search indexes individual words (no stemming or nuffing) and Ivor wrote a wrapper to do phrase searches
17:14 <@noidd> cool, i must take a look - thx

18:39 <@Kake> They make web board things; they advertised on jobs.perl.org

18:44 <@Kake> Oh, right, thought you might have meant being disorganised was a crap reason for not wanting to be a contractor :)  At least they sent a rejection; recruiters often don't bother (not that this was through a recruiter).
18:44 < itz_> I don't think email applications are any use at the moment unless you telephone the company first and make them interested in you

22:24 <@Greg> very nice
22:24 <@Greg> blech would love ity
22:24 <@Greg> it
22:24 <@Greg> colder than uk
22:24 <@robin_sz> is it light all night
22:24 <@Greg> great transport
22:24 <@Greg> nice people
22:24 <@Greg> robin_sz: it is still about the same light as 6 or 7pm here
22:24 <@Greg> and pickled herring is great
22:25 <@robin_sz> yep, thats a speciality,
22:25 <@robin_sz> also crayfish
22:25 <@Greg> and lots and lots of roe
22:25 <@Greg> and salmon
22:25 <@Greg> and most seafish
22:25 <@robin_sz> smoked flounder is a good thing they do out there
22:26 <@Greg> everything ive tried is good so far
22:26 <@robin_sz> 'flunderfest' is an event later in the year ...
22:26 <@Greg> they dont go for simple food per se, but they do go for what works
22:26 <@Greg> what is flunderfest?
22:26 <@robin_sz> you just try and eat as much smoked flounder as is possible
22:26 <@Greg> excellent
22:26 <@robin_sz> ISTR its the end of july
22:27 <@Greg> scarily i might be back about then
22:27 <@Greg> with a german colleague
22:27 <@robin_sz> excellent.
22:27 <@robin_sz> is she blonde?
22:27 <@Greg> he is
22:27 <@robin_sz> oh well ...
22:27 <@robin_sz> if you get drunk enough you wont care 
22:27 <@Greg> true, true
22:28 <@Greg> i'll give him sausage all right ;-)
22:28  * Greg wonders just how much dialup from the hotel for last few hours has cost
22:28 <@robin_sz> dunno
22:29 <@Greg> dont really care
22:29 <@Greg> but i reckon its a lot
22:29 <@robin_sz> my GPRS from switzerland (using orange .ch when I am an ornage uk customer, so I thought it would be cheap enough)
22:29 <@robin_sz> cost me 10GBP /Mb
22:29 <@Greg> ouch
22:29 <@robin_sz> indeed.
22:30 <@Greg> bet you loved those spammers ;-)
22:30 <@yoda> can someone else have a look at the safari site and see if you get an error?
22:30 <@Greg> nope
22:30 <@Greg> it would be too painful on 30kbps minus the VPN overhead
22:30 <@Greg> robin_sz?
22:30 <+dipsy> it has been said that robin_sz is thing when pasting blocks of text or certain that there is complete bollocks, masquerading as art
22:30 <@robin_sz> I was viewing my email using the demon web interface, so thankfully it was brolemn as ususal
22:31 <@robin_sz> I would if yoda had giben the URL and said what the error might be
22:31 <@yoda> it's safari.oreilly.com, and if you get an error you'll know it
22:31 <@Greg> yoda: oh that safari
22:31 <@yoda> oh, it's working again now
22:31 <@Greg> i thought you were talking about the browser
22:31 <@Greg> which i didnt think cost
22:32 <@Greg> but i would put anything past st. jobs
22:32 <@yoda> i guess they were doing some sort of update

22:35 <@DrHyde> no intention of getting one either, cos I'm Far Too Ugly

22:36 <@Greg> robin_sz: so what does it feel like to be an OAP?
22:36 <@robin_sz> and that kangaroo was BIG
22:37 <@robin_sz> in the trouser deptartment if you knwo what I mean
22:37 <@DrHyde> dipsy, spell satirism
22:37 <+dipsy> Possible spellings for satirism: satirist

22:38  * robin_sz jumps up and down and does the 'im getting broadband' dance
22:39 <@AlexMc> can anyone recommend a windows program to stop you from getting RSI etc ... by telling you to take a break every so often?
22:39 <@Greg> AlexMc: linujx
22:39 <@robin_sz> AlexMc: yes ...
22:39 <@Greg> linux
22:39 <@AlexMc> robin_sz: I'm happy for you
22:39 <@Quidity> Doesn't windows do that automatically by crashing every half hour?
22:39 <@robin_sz> try 'format C:'
22:39 <@AlexMc> Greg: thanks
22:39 <@AlexMc> robin_sz: double thanks
22:39 <@Quidity> But you could do one
22:39  * Greg watches the office with swedish subtitles
22:39 <@Quidity> with tk, and sleep(45*3600)
22:40 <@Greg> its even better this way!
22:40 <@robin_sz> do they have red hot swedish porn on after the news?
22:40 <@Greg> more sort of during the news
22:40 <@robin_sz> nice
22:41 <@Greg> i'm just sorry i ddint see the news when there was reports of sadamn bulidng 100 foot plus superguns
22:41 <@robin_sz> AlexMc: RSI is more related to seating position and arm position than taking breaks
22:43 <@robin_sz> (the fucking labour party)-- # for fucks sake, you had 'ban fox hunting' in your manifesto, twice. its got a massive majority in the commons .. just support the bill you two faced arsewipes.
22:44 <@AlexMc> robin_sz:  maybe I was bulking a bunch of things into RSI - but a friend has been reocmmended to take breaks every 20 minutes or so
22:45 <@robin_sz> yes, thats a good plan
22:45 <@AlexMc> grrr, just discovered OpenOffice managed to lose a document
22:45 <@robin_sz> get one of those 'kneeling' chairs
22:46 <@Greg> nij inte dirty birty!
22:47 <@robin_sz> AlexMc: http://www.healthyback.com/store/sitting/tempur-pedic_kneeling_chair.htm # there are UK variants for less wonga
22:50 <@AlexMc> robin_sz: it is for a friend - and she doesn't even live in London
22:50 <@AlexMc> but yes - good advice
22:51 <@robin_sz> most wrist/carpal tunnel problems actually stem from upper back problems apparently ...
22:51 <@Greg> AlexMc: im not sure id recommend a compute rbased solution
22:51 <@Greg> more just working comfortably and using the computer sensibly
22:51 <@Greg> e.g. use paper /diaries/address books as well
22:51 <@Greg> send more letters
22:51 <@Greg> talk to people on the phone
22:52 <@Greg> but thats all my crazy ideas
22:52 <@cnb> There's some program called coffee break pro for mac, dunno if there is a win version tho
22:52 <@robin_sz> when I was at the BBC we had fil editor who would sit for 16~18 hours a day .. loads of em had kneck/back/wrist problems, one got a kneeling chair and it helped, soon they all had em 
22:52 <@robin_sz> film editors even

00:08 <@DrHyde> then there's also the composite vs RGB issues
00:08 <@DrHyde> so in fact i might just go and buy a vcr which does svideo and an svideo cable instead. grrr.
00:08 <@yoda> most cables are wired in both directions though. it is possible i guess, though normally you pay more for it
00:09 <@DrHyde> yes well this cable was only a fiver ;-)
00:09 <@yoda> to get a video with svideo you'd need an svhs box. prices /have/ come down, but are still more expensive

11:50  * TeeJay finds the mozilla javascript debugger very funky
11:50 <@TeeJay> ..but not what he needs
11:51 <@TeeJay> cool mozilla 1.4 has better javascript error detection tho'
11:51 <@TeeJay> this is definately a good thing

12:04 <@DrHyde> doh!
12:05  * DrHyde should remember that lines in a perl program happen one after the other and that the interpreter doesn't magically make my code multi-threaded and thread-safe
12:05 <@DrHyde> IOW, if I change a piece of data and then expect to use the old value a bit later, Bad Shit will happen
12:06 <@blech_> T39m++ # through a full washing machine cycle, still works
12:06 <@Magnus> good grief
12:08 <@blech_> Is that at the phone working, or my presence? :)
12:08 <@Magnus> the phone
12:08 <@Magnus> did the numbers wash off the front or anything
12:09 <@blech_> Um...
12:09 <@Magnus> did it come out whiter than white?
12:09 <@blech_> No. It was on a pocket on the inside of a pair of quite heavy combats though.
12:10 <@TeeJay> reassigning bugs is much quicker than that debugging crap
12:10  * DrHyde is such a fucktard
12:10  * Magnus agrees
12:10 <@Magnus> hey
12:10 <@Magnus> does anyone use washing powder tablest?
12:10 <@Magnus> does anyone use washing powder tablets?
12:10 <@Magnus> 'cos I've just found you can actually get the same stuff, but in powder form
12:10 <@hex> You wouldn't believe how smooth they make my stools.
12:11 <@hex> It's like being a baby all over again.
12:11 <@Magnus> and rather than those annoying tables that you have to unwrap and put inside a silly little bag
12:11  * DrHyde stops all his programs, deletes evyerhting from the database, and prepares to redo everything from the past several hours
12:11 <@Magnus> you can just put a cup in a tray at the top of the washing machine
12:11 <@Magnus> it's so easy!
12:11 <@hex> DrHyde: bummer. What did you do wrong?

12:11 -!- hex changed the topic of #london.pm to: #london.persil with your host, Magnus
12:12 <@DrHyde> it's complicated to explain, but basically i accidentally made about 400,000 phone calls international when they, errm, shouldn't have been
12:12 <@mstevens> hmm, scribot is broke
12:12 <@hex> DrHyde: eek :)
12:12 <@chrisc> has anyone tried generating tabulated data using pdflib?
12:12 <@Magnus> 400,000?
12:13 <@blech_> Magnus: it's not as easy as the goo bags.
12:13 <@Magnus> ooh I haven't tried them
12:13 <@Magnus> you just bung them in?
12:13 <@blech_> Yes, and they seem to work fine.
12:13 <@Magnus> no unwrapping?
12:13 <@Magnus> no silly cup to put them in
12:14 <@blech_> Only to open the plastic bag with the first one.
12:14  * Magnus will check'em out
12:18 <@DrHyde> Magnus: yes.  thankfully, these are historical records for billing purposes, not live calls :-)
12:18 <@Ranguard> DrHyde: not you calling 0898 numbers then :) ?
12:19 <@blech_> 0898? There's a blast from the past.
12:19 <@Magnus> DrHyde: who are you working for?
12:19 <@Ranguard> or what ever the new version is :)

12:22 <@hex> Ding! Give that man a cigar.
12:22 <@vorsprung> hmm my unit tests seem worryingly faster than yesterday
12:23 <@vorsprung> i guess that's the magic of java
12:23  * hex calls the number for old times' sake
12:24 <@hex> Whoa! Now it's the Crimewatch UK number.
12:24 <@Magnus> what, 0181?
12:24 <@blech_> 020 8811 8181 now?
12:24 <@hex> Yes, what blech_ said.
12:24 <@hex> Not quite so catchy, sadly.
12:27 <@DrHyde> spot the mistake: CPU states:  83.6% user,  16.6% system,   0.0% nice,  -0.2% idle
12:28 <@Magnus> scribot?
12:28 <+dipsy> it has been said that scribot is #london.pm's blogging bot or at http://www.scribot.com/ or new and improved or (see scribot2) or (see scrilink) or (raw data at http://astray.com/scribot/scribot.blog) or an ugly, simple hack that's getting better all the time or not related to scriborg
12:28 <@Magnus> scribot: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3037182.stm # Cunt.  Can't say it too many times.
12:29 <@blech_> So you've not been prejudiced by the media coverage then.

12:30 <@noidd> scriptbot, http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3036092.stm ## This our Matt Sargent?
12:30 <@blech_> Yes it is. And you spelt scribot wrong.
12:30 <@Trelane> wow, that's a terrible suit Leslie is wearing
12:30 <@noidd> scribot, http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3036092.stm ## This our Matt Sargent?
12:30 <@noidd> fixed :-)
12:31 <@Dom2> baud's been getting in the media lots recently
12:31 <@acme> "Mail order brides are not BA's normal line of business."
12:32  * Dom2 grins
12:32 <@Dom2> I wouldn't say that's exactly true - they;ll ship anybody.
12:34 <@Magnus> did anyone see the programme on eskimo's on monday night?
12:34 <@Magnus> they ate raw seals stuffed with dead birds that had been buried underground for six weeks
12:34 <@acme> stop it, you're making me hungry
12:34 <@Dom2> I'm surprised that they could get into them without an axe after being frozen for that long.
12:35 <@chrisc> that's what I've got for test this evening
12:35 <@hex> "Superzonda appeared about five or six months ago," said Steve, tapping away at one of the bank of computer screens in front of him.
12:35 <@Dom2> chrisc: frozen seals?
12:35 <@hex> "They are at the moment probably one of the worst spam outfits on the internet for the amount of stuff that they do." 
12:35 <@chrisc> s/test/tea/; ;-)
12:35 <@hex> ...but not one single Google hit for them?
12:35 <@chrisc> Dom2: on a sticj
12:35  * chrisc can't type...
12:35 <@Trelane> hmm
12:35 <@Dom2> chrisc: No, I think we need an Acme::Test::Seal
12:35 <@Magnus> super-zond
12:35 <@Magnus> super-zonda
12:35 <@DrHyde> mmm, tea.  good idea
12:35 <@acme> hex: super-zonda
12:35 <@Trelane> bbc doing their normal crap again
12:36 <@chrisc> Dom2: there's definitely a niche there
12:36 <@hex> Magnus/acme: ta

12:37 <@chrisc> Dom2: six_weeks_old( $seal );
12:37 <@Trelane> Dom2: nah, it's not clever enough
12:37 <@Trelane> it's silly enough, but not clever enough
12:37 <@Trelane> you need to make it both clever and silly
12:37 <@hex> acme: damn you! I was about to paste that
12:38 <@Trelane> ooh, the frozen thing could identify if it's been frozen with Storable
12:38  * CPAN upload: Language-Homespring-0.04 by IAMCAL
12:38 <@Magnus> remind me who is danny wallace
12:41 <@chrisc> anyone know of any good pointers on optimising table cell sizes?
12:41 <@TeeJay> can anyone think why I might be having a record inserted twice on an insert ?
12:42 <@Magnus> because you're crap
12:42 <@chrisc> TeeJay: you're calling the insert twice? ;-)
12:42 <@Magnus> use flat text files instead of sql
12:43 <@TeeJay> chrisc: ho ho
12:43  * DrHyde would prefer syntax like $seal->frozen()->aged('6w')->contains('birds');
12:43  * TeeJay liberally sprinkles some more warns in his sub
12:44 <@DrHyde> ideally we'd pass a coderef to contains() so it could check that it contains objects of type 'Bird' which have the 'dead' attribute
12:48 <@chrisc> indeed, but should we not first concentrate on first identifying the attributes of a seal object? seems like we're jumping the gun a bit to worry about its ornithological status first
12:49 -!- claes [claes@c-2e8c71d5.06-12-73746f15.cust.bredbandsbolaget.se] has quit [BitchX: EPIC on steroids.]
12:49 <@DrHyde> nono, design just enough of the Seal object to fit the current problem
12:50 <@DrHyde> for instance, for cookery purposes we care not whether it's an African or a European seal
12:52 <@vorsprung> TeeJay, sounds like a job for "unit test man"
12:53 <@vorsprung> TeeJay, faster than a speeding bullet, unit test man leaps tall bugs in a single bound
12:53 <@hex> Oh no!! Giant bugs are destroying the city!
12:54 <@hex> Don't worry, miss! Look, it's UNIT TEST MAN!
12:54 <@hex> vorsprung: what are his special powers?
12:54 <@vorsprung> hex, he has an Assert-o-ray
12:55 <@vorsprung> hex, but that's about it
12:55 <@hex> heh
12:55 <@vorsprung> hex, in "tales of incredible programing" #4556 comic book he has an epic battle with "bad test data woman"
12:56 <@vorsprung> hex, she is only beaten when "integrity checker boy" rescues him from a radioactive maze
12:57 <@hex> say, is that the one that leads to him fighting the Empire of Big Design Up Front?
12:59 <@vorsprung> hex, no...that's after he meets Mr. Extreme.  Him and Mr. Extreme should be able to work together, but Mr. Extreme is a bit of a berk
12:59 <@hex> :)
13:00 <@TeeJay> ah - found the bug
13:01 <@TeeJay> somebody was inserting records that should have been (and were being) inserted by a trigger on the table he had just updated
13:01 <@TeeJay> that was fun
13:01 <@DrHyde> now go and put an appropriate uniqueness constraint on the table
13:02 <@DrHyde> cos you can *guarantee* that the same mistake will be made again
13:03 <@TeeJay> DrHyde: we already have one
13:03 <@TeeJay> kind of
13:03 <@DrHyde> obviously not the right one
13:03 <@TeeJay> but it was breaking things so demanded it was removed
13:03 <@vorsprung> DrHyde, i don't see how a constraint would help
13:03 <@TeeJay> now it probably needs to be put back in
13:03 <@DrHyde> vorsprung: it would stop the second insert
13:03 <@TeeJay> DrHyde: it would until I demanded it was removed because it was breaking my code
13:04 <@Ranguard> Anyone know if I'm doing an 'update foo .. where bar' will $DBI::rows always be '0' or '-1' if the where didn't match ?
13:04 <@TeeJay> we can probably drop the primary key we inserted to get around the problem too
13:04  * Ranguard can't find it in the docs
13:04 <@TeeJay> shame we have made a dogs dinner of the data now
13:05 <@Ranguard> TeeJay: I've got one of those - it's got 1900 records when it should only have 41 :)
13:05 <@vorsprung> Ranguard, 0e0 I think
13:05 <@Ranguard> 0e0 ?
13:05 <+dipsy> 0e0 is probably a hack
13:05 <@DrHyde> 0e0 means "0 but successful"
13:05 <@Ranguard> ahh, that's a new one on me - cheers :)
13:06  * DrHyde points ranguard at the fine manual :-)
13:06  * Ranguard looks around and can't work out which one DrHyde is pointing to
13:06 <@richardc> Ranguard: those semantics have changed iirc
13:07 <@richardc> and you're really better off just not relying on them
13:07 <@TeeJay> 0e0 tends to mean no records inserted or updated but nothing bad happened either
13:07 <@TeeJay> check $dbh->errstr
13:07 <@DrHyde> perldoc DBI
13:07 <@Ranguard> I want to do: if($DBI::rows < 1) { # nothing to update so do insert }
13:08 <@richardc> Ranguard: no you don't
13:08 <@DrHyde> and it's 0E0, not 0e0
13:08 <@richardc> you want to try an insert, catch the error you get when your constraints don't allow it, and do an update
13:08 <@TeeJay> 0E0 also means 'I did what you said and nothing bad happened, in fact nothing happened at all - that *is* what you meant isnt it?'
13:08 <@Magnus> whoooooooooop anyone know any good general sources of VCDs?
13:09 <@DrHyde> dddhouse.com
13:09 <@Ranguard> DrHyde: cheers :)

13:20 <@blech_> Does jpegtran require images to be multiples of 16 pixels in size?
13:21 <@hex> richardc: installing libexpat1-dev seems to have fixed it. 
13:22 <@richardc> missing headers then
13:22 <@acme> blech_: yes
13:22 <@acme> or it'll get the last n wrong
13:22 <@blech_> acme: in both dimensions?
13:23 <@acme> that's how it works
13:23 <@acme> jpeg images are cut up into 16x16. jpegtran just rearranges the squares magically

13:34 <@richardc> hex: by end-of-line do you mean end of file?
13:36 <@hex> richardc: No, I mean, when you press the down key on your keyboard the cursor won't move to the line directly below it, but the "logical line"(?) below it - that is, the next line that occurs after a linebreak.
13:36 <@hex> I'm not sure quite how to describe this, save that the cursor behaves in a way that I'm not used to.
13:36 <@blech_> hex: is this with soft wrapping on or something?
13:36 <@hex> blech_: Yes.
13:36 <@richardc> dunno. never managed to make it do that
13:36 <@richardc> ah. you have very very long lines?
13:37 <@hex> Yeah. Options > Display > Wrap Long Lines is on.
13:37 <@richardc> and you want it to pretend a long line is really another line?
13:38 <@richardc> no then. I don't know how you do that.  I tend not to have stupidly long lines
13:38 <@hex> Um, I suppose so. I just want the cursor to move up and down one by one line.
13:38 <@richardc> it is moving by one line
13:38 <@hex> Fair enough. I blame whoever wrote this file I'm editing...
13:38 <@acme> which file?
13:38 <+dipsy> somebody said which file was the libxml stuff. i can still see Embperl::DOM stuff around

13:39  * hex nods
13:39  * acme points at dialog
13:39 <@richardc> no it's not.  it's a long-term fix that allows you to do useful things linke print the file
13:40 <@hex> richardc: No, it is a short term fix, because it won't help me edit other people's files with stupidly long lines in them.
13:40 <@mstevens> dipsy, forget which file
13:40 <+dipsy> mstevens: I forgot which file
13:40 <@hex> I just want the cursor to move one character at a time, up, down, left or right.
13:40 <@richardc> yes it is, because you institue a standard which states that stupidly long lines aren't allowed.  or you figure out how to reporgram your editor
13:41  * Magnus just makes his screen wider
13:42 <@hex> richardc: firstly, I'm not the institutor of standards. Secondly, reprogram xemacs? Yeah, right.
13:43 <@hex> I fix line lengths when I see them. This does not mean I won't encounter erroneous ones in the future.
13:43 <@richardc> you could rebind down to do something that frobs current-window-line
13:44 <@richardc> you will if you get the intitutor of standards to, well, institute a standard

13:53 <@AlexMc> PerfDave: who said that?
13:54 <@PerfDave> AlexMc: Somebody on LJ. The export tool gives you an XMLy representation of your journal, but there's currently not much you can *do* with said representation (except keyword-index it, which quite a few people I know do)

13:56 <@mstevens> robin: why?

13:57 <@AlexMc> I'm looking into running an LJ system for book fans *if* I can get enough publisher support to pay for it
13:57 <@PerfDave> People were talking about client-side backup tools (as opposed to LJ's own backups of their own servers), and this is the best way for users to get local copies of their LJ entries.

14:06 <@cnb> marnameow: the outside is like a restaurant for cats. Lot's of delicious things like rats, mice, and birds.
14:07 <@marnameow> My cats are scared of outside. They know that food comes form the kitchen cupboard (and sometimes the fridge).
14:09 <@muttley> then they are poor imitiations of felines
14:09 <@robin_sz> marnameow: this is not true. it is perfectly possible to not be at work and not starve. I know severla people who do this.

16:41 <@cnb> if you put enough monkeys in front of enough browsers, they will eventually recreate the entire works of shakespear in the form of webserver logs?
16:42 <@Trelane> no.  Monkeys do not hit keys randomly
16:43 <@TeeJay> mstevens: nothing wrong with reading web logs
16:43  * TeeJay likes grepping his weblogs for interesting things
16:43 <@TeeJay> now I have over 10MB for autodia logs alone its a bit slow
16:43 <@PerfDave> They can hit keys randomly, but the distribution isn't something that could ever produce Shakespeare, AFAICR
16:45 <@richardc> surely given infinite monkeys you end up with one who through mutation *is* shakespeare
16:46 <@richardc> then the tricky thing is inspiring the bugger
16:46 <@Trelane> is shakespear's twin
16:46 <@Trelane> and not in the danny devito sence
16:47 <@Trelane> actually, you have an infinite number of shakespeare's twins
16:47 <@TeeJay> richardc: easy - persuade him his father was a wool seller in 17th century england and put him thru elizabethan religious persecution and give him a girlfriend 7 years his senior
16:47 <@richardc> yarr
16:47 <@Trelane> this is making my head hurt
16:47 <@TeeJay> but then you could equally end up with work resembling Marlowe or other contempories
16:47 <@Trelane> someone write out the conjunctions for this
16:48 <@Dom2> me-- # cleaning keyboard revelas how much beard lossage I suffer
16:48 <@richardc> you'd also need an infinite number of gweneth paltrows
16:48 <@blech_> richardc++
16:48 <@Dom2> richardc: Now that's a scary thought.
16:48 <@Trelane> richardc: luckly, though mutation, you'd also have that
16:48 <@Dom2> richardc: Just think of all the flouncy dresses yo'd have to acquire first
16:50 <@DrHyde> ugh, i hate it when i have to insert a patch to make a well-tested, known-correct bit of code do more
16:50 <@richardc> DrHyde: naah, you just rerun the tests
16:50 <@DrHyde> i fear that the patch is going to be hard to read :_)
16:50 <@Dom2> DrHyde: But that's where good tests really come in to play
16:50 <@DrHyde> sure, but think maintainability
16:51 <@richardc> and since it's well-tested and known good, you should have no problems
16:51 <@richardc> I are.  with sufficent correct tests you can refactor it so it's clearer too
16:52 <@richardc> Dom2: good point.  the theory only allows for infinity monkeys and typewriters, not infinite flouncy dresses
16:52 <@richardc> maybe you could rade some of the typewriters in
16:53 <@Trelane> miss paltrow can operate without flouncy dresses
16:53 <@PerfDave> Infinite monkeys would mean infinitely many tailor-monkeys (a bit like howler monkeys but with needle and thread) to make flouncy dresses.
16:53 <@Trelane> she did fine without any of them in great expectations
16:53 < rataxis> does anybody know where Upper Wimpole St is?
16:54 <@richardc> but she didn't have to deal with infinite shakespeares then
16:54  * rataxis could just use streetmap...
16:54 <@richardc> rataxis: so do
16:54  * rataxis is
16:54 <@Trelane> near lower wimpole street?
16:54 <@Trelane> get a proper browser and set up a streetmap shortcut
16:54 <@richardc> and some pie
16:54 <@Trelane> (pie is optional, but recommended)
16:55 <@blech_> love your pie
16:55 <@davorg> it's just north (and a bit west) of john lewis
16:55 <@blech_> but don't luuuuurve your pie
16:55 <@Trelane> hey, look, it's the pie fucker
16:56 < rataxis> this one time at band camp
16:56 < rataxis> um
16:56 < rataxis> wrong window
16:56  * dipsy removes your bra
16:56 < rataxis> but /remarkably/ apposite.
16:56  * rataxis grins
16:57 <@blech_> Oh dear. Sky One doesn't half show some shit.
16:57 <@Trelane> you've only just realised this?
16:57 <@PerfDave> 90% of TV is shit ;)
16:58 <@blech_> No, it's just the trailer for Surf Girls reminded me.
16:58 <@mstevens> rataxis: sushi!
16:58 <@blech_> Compete against three other surfers for the chance 'to go pro'.

16:59 <@mstevens> Angel is quite good
16:59 <@Magnus> everything except Angel, 24, and the Worlds Most Amazing Animals
16:59 <@davorg> mstevens: but not on sky one
16:59 <@Trelane> Angel has comlpleted
16:59 <@DrHyde> angel is arse
16:59 <@Magnus> you know
16:59 <@Magnus> the one presented by that gay guy
16:59 <@Magnus> Angel has not completed
16:59 <@Magnus> they start filming the new season at the end of the month
16:59 <@davorg> season 4 has
16:59 <@mstevens> davorg: I'm still in season 1
17:00 <@davorg> mstevens: that's not on sky either
17:01 <@Trelane> I need more TV to watch
17:01 <@Trelane> since we've watched all of most of the shows we taught the Tivo to record
17:01 <@blech_> Get TiVo to record MTV2 and The Amp.
17:01 <@Trelane> blech_: that's not TV.  That's music
17:01 <@DrHyde> woo! aerosmith on the radio!
17:01 <@Trelane> and I don't need to _watch_ music
17:02 <@richardc> did you see if CSI:Miami was available?
17:02 <@Trelane> no.  But I imagine it'll be the same as CSI:NotInMiami
17:02 <@blech_> Trelane: that's why it's ideal background TV material.
17:02 <@richardc> it is, but it has different actors
17:03 <@Trelane> It's like quincy on speed
17:04 <@richardc> did you ever see when the 11'O clock show did "Narman Wisdom on Acid"?
17:04 <@richardc> s/Narm/Norm/
17:05 <@Trelane> Norm!
17:06 <@Trelane> dipsy, Norm is <reply>What'll it be, Mr PetersonFISH
17:06 <+dipsy> OK, Trelane.
17:06 <@richardc> fed up with lazy reviewers using the tired phrase "$thing on $drug" they gave Norman Wisdom Acid to see if he'd act like Lee Evans
17:06 <@Trelane> dipsy Norm =~ s/FISH/?/
17:06 <+dipsy> OK, Trelane
17:06 <@richardc> they concluded that since Lee Evens didn't act like a scared old man hallucinating, then it wasn't really accurate
17:09 <@Magnus> did they actually get Norman Wisdom to do it
17:09 <@richardc> don't think so
17:10 <@Magnus> oh.
17:10 <@Magnus> I quite liked it when Buzz Aldrin appeared on Trigger Happy
17:11 <@davorg> That wasn't Buzz Aldrin
17:11 <@TeeJay> mod_layout-- # breaks badly with ssl
17:11 <@Magnus> of course it was
17:11 <@Magnus> it's not funny unless it really is
17:12 <@davorg> it really wasn't
17:12 <@davorg> it wasn't carol decker either
17:12 <@Magnus> and I suppose it wasn't Ian Botham, Bill Wyman
17:12 <@DrHyde> buzz aldrin's parents must have really hated him to give him such a silly name
17:12 <@Magnus> Terry Gilliam, Alice Cooper, Tony Blackburn
17:12 <@Magnus> Ken Livingstone, Jason Donovan
17:12 <@Magnus> Tamara Beckwith, Tim Rice
17:13 <@chrisc> Magnus: Don't forget Peter Stringfellow.
17:13 <@davorg> the ones in the interviews were the real people
17:14 <@davorg> but Aldrin was only ever shown from a distance
17:14 <@Magnus> but it's not funny if it's not really him
17:14 <@davorg> i still laughed
17:15 <@Magnus> TV Tome lists him as a guest star
17:15 <@davorg> i know
17:15 <@davorg> and if it's on the internet then it must be right :)
17:16 <@mstevens> ms
17:17 <@Magnus> why do you think it's not Buzz
17:17 <@Magnus> Buzz is a media whore
17:17 <@davorg> what, other than it looking nothing like him?
17:18 <@Magnus> you may have a point.
17:18 <@davorg> :)
17:18 <@Magnus> (dom joly)--
17:19 <@Magnus> how dare he
17:19  * davorg reads www.buzzaldrin.com

17:24 <@davorg> your trees?
17:25 <@marnameow> I ordered trees. The courier company are being impressively inept.
17:25 <@marnameow> Impressive even for a courier company.
17:25  * davorg finds the concept of mail order trees strangely amusing
17:27 <@marnameow> How else am I meant to get three trees home?
17:27 <@davorg> taxi?
17:27 <+dipsy> rumour has it taxi is an excellent french film by Luc Besson and has great car chases
17:28 <@marnameow> I'm sure tha taxi-driver would love that!
17:28 <@davorg> dipsy, are you sure you're not thinking of "subway"
17:28 <+dipsy> OK, davorg.
17:28 <@hex> dipsy dipsy?
17:28 <+dipsy> it has been said that i am <req>so-named, I think, because \ antenna looks like a dipstick. or blech's bitch or confused about their gender or a bad influence or an apparently useful bot or publically accessible *ph34r* or going out with slavorg or a raving queen or one of the two male teletubbies (the green one), the other being tinky winky or a generalised encyclopedia or fond of doodles or a crap bot or useless
17:28 <@TeeJay> bah - the phone I ordered from o2 is out of stock
17:28 <@hex> hmm
17:29 <@hex> dipsy dipsy,?
17:29 <+dipsy> arr you sure you didn't mean mun-KEH?
17:29 <@muttley> dipsy: no. Subway has Christpher Lambert and surrealism. Taxi has car chases and, errm, good music
17:29 <@hex> hmm
17:29 <+dipsy> muttley: i'm not following you...
17:29 <@muttley> davorg: even
17:29 <@TeeJay> christopher lambert rocks
17:29 <@davorg> doesn't subway have good music too?
17:29 <@muttley> well, yes
17:29 <@muttley> but a different type of good music
17:30 <@muttley> essentially Taxi is one long, very good car chase
17:30  * TeeJay wonders what his excuse for buying 2 dvd's will be when his wife notices that we have *even* _more_ kung fu
17:30 <@hex> Hmm. What exactly does Iain Tatch's sig do? Running it produces nothing for me.
17:30 <@muttley> but done in an inimitably gallic style
17:30 <@davorg> surely Christoper Lambert only ever made three good films - Subway, Highlander and Greystoke
17:30 <@davorg> and the last of those is a bit suspect
17:30 <@TeeJay> davorg: you are forgetting mortal kombat
17:30 <@muttley> Knight Moves
17:30 <@TeeJay> he is good but the rest of it sucks
17:30 <@davorg> TeeJay: i'm not you know :)
17:31 <@muttley> and  <the one where he's in japan>
17:31 <@TeeJay> muttley: highlander 3 - 'A new plot!'
17:31 <@davorg> muttley: of, is that Black Rain?
17:32  * TeeJay is tempted to see how cheap he can get a video or dvd of kickboxer for
17:32 <@TeeJay> I haven't seen it for ages

17:32 <@davorg> kind of gave up on him after Highlander 2
17:32 <@muttley> actually, I just like it cos of the Ninjas
17:32 <@muttley> You'd like The Sicilian 
17:33 <@muttley> it's based on a Mario "Godfather" Puzo book
17:33 -!- hex changed the topic of #london.pm to: www.tajima-tei.co.uk tonight | <muttley> actually, I just like it cos of the Ninjas
17:33 <@TeeJay> what would Puzo know about Ninja and a decent round house kick
17:33 <@blech_> More than you, gaijin.
17:34 <@PerfDave> Nothing wrong with ninjas :)
17:34 <@muttley> Puzo, errm. Nothing. Which is why I suspect he stuck to books about the Mafia.
17:34 <@muttley> Unless there's a sekrit Real Ultimate Power [tm] Ninja Mountain base in Sicily
17:34 <@muttley> and I totally misread the subcontext of the book
17:35 <@DrHyde> sicily++
17:35 <@DrHyde> even if it has a scilly name
17:35 <@hex> Real Ultimate Mafia!

17:55 <@TeeJay> spooks is shit anyway
17:55 <@davorg> yeah. but most excellent shit

17:56 <@TeeJay> go time
17:56 <@TeeJay> sorry - go tim
17:56 <@yaxu> one of the episodes of spooks was filmed in state51

17:56 <@Magnus> it's not exactly 24, is it

17:57 <@Magnus> they should have her get naked

17:57 <+dipsy> somebody said then was that possible?
17:58 <@davorg> Magnus: why not save time and just kill her?
17:58 <@davorg> why bother to get her naked first?
17:58 <@TeeJay> AlexMc: whats your bosses face like now ? tim should win this set
17:59 <@mstevens> davorg: if she gets naked magnus gets to see more naked girls
18:00 <@blech_> mstevens: let's face it, it's the only way he will.
18:00 <@davorg> and that's good why?
18:00 <@mstevens> davorg: davorg: I think magnus is one of those people who find looking at naked girls enjoyable.
18:01 <@Magnus> oi
18:01 <@mstevens> of course, this is just a theory
18:01 <@hex> Er, is that wrong?
18:01 <@davorg> he's got a whole internet of naked "chicks" why does he need to spoil my tv viewing?
18:01 <@mstevens> hex: davorg seems to think so
18:02 <@TeeJay> nakid chix aren't the same on the interwb
18:02 <@hex> Because I am happy to admit that I, personally, like looking at naked girls. It is everyone's right not to if they so wish, though, and gratuitous nudity in inappropriate places is to be condemned.
18:03 <@hex> </soapbox>
18:03 <@davorg> hex: this is my point. it would be gratuitous.
18:03 <@Trelane> what, like tescos?
18:03 <@Magnus> how about they spin Kim off into her own show

13:23  * CPAN upload: Math-Geometry-Planar-Offset-1.02 by DVDPOL
13:23 <@vorsprung> it is plain text at the moment
13:23 <@PerfDave> DrHyde: That's *so* 70s, man
13:23 <@robin_sz> 123-reg.co.uk # cheap beyond belief, and a tasty blonde tart on the homepage too
13:23  * DrHyde weaves flowers in his hair
13:23  * aef is born
13:23 <@richardc> use pod, or wiki format
13:24 <@PerfDave> DrHyde: Are you going to San Franciso?
13:24 <@DrHyde> PerfDave: is that near Peckham?
13:24 <@vorsprung> I want to have sensitivity labelling, time/date stamping for most things, and typing for various things that I do
13:25 <@robin_sz> 123-reg are charging just 2.59 a year (2.50 registry fee, 9p for them) for .co.uk's ... I think that the domain registration market has hit the floor :)
13:25 <@DrHyde> robin_sz: plus fees for moving the domain away, plus ...
13:25 <@robin_sz> DrHyde: no move away fee
13:25 <@vorsprung> for instance I want a set of tags for procedures, for code fragments, for todo lists, for faults, for contact details
13:25 <@TeeJay> hmmmm sneaky comma hid in our xml query phrasebook
13:25 <@yoda> is that for single domain purchases?
13:25 <@robin_sz> DrHyde: free web forwarding, free email forwarding ...
13:25 <@TeeJay> 2800 lines of SQL wrapped in xml
13:26 <@TeeJay> that is always fun to merge
13:26 <@PerfDave> DrHyde: Apparently, you're gonna to meet some gentle people there
13:26 <@PerfDave> DrHyde: Or failing that, a tall dark stranger
13:26 <@PerfDave> vorsprung: Use DocBook!
13:26 <@robin_sz> DrHyde: its dog-eat-dog (and pay the other dog for the privilege) out there 
13:26 <@robin_sz> yoda: yep
13:26 <@vorsprung> PerfDave, yeah it would be like docbook
13:27 <@robin_sz> yoda: it drops to 2.58 for bulk :)
13:27 <@vorsprung> PerfDave, but with less tags than the 300 odd that docbook has
13:27 <@PerfDave> vorsprung: The more *tags*, the more *XML*! :)
13:28 <@Dom2> PerfDave: google for parsimonious XML
13:28 <@vorsprung> PerfDave, then I could do things like extract all my procedures and publish them automatically, give my boss a list of recent activity and how todo lists are progressing, generate a catalog of code fragments
13:29 <@PerfDave> vorsprung: I hear Perl's useful for that ;)
13:29 <@vorsprung> PerfDave, and probably a million other things I haven't even thought of yet
13:30 <@PerfDave> Yes, perl is useful for a million other things you haven't even thought of yet :)
13:30 <@robin_sz> hmm .. that blonde tart on 123-reg.co.uk does look uncannily like zoe ball
13:30 <@PerfDave> That reminds me, I should rewrite my MP3 organising script to use an ID3 tag munging module instead of shelling out to id3v2
13:31 <@TeeJay> dipsy: aps ?
13:31 <+dipsy> teejay: i don't know
13:31 <@TeeJay> dipsy: asp ?
13:31 <+dipsy> hmmm... asp is Active Server Pages from the greedy folks at Microsoft, a web programming system for IIS/NT only (until emulators get working). or not CGI, so don't ask about it on #CGI or a poisonous and dangerous snake that should be avoided or A Stupid Program or an Asshole Service Provider or Application Service Provider or Alternative Sexual Practises or a badly broken
13:32 <@TeeJay> dipsy: asp is also Absolutely Shit Programmers
13:32 <+dipsy> okay, TeeJay.
13:34 <@robin_sz> 12 days to ADSL day ... :)
13:37 <@blech_> PerfDave: probably not. The state of the art on Perl id3 tagging is fairly low.
13:38 <@blech_> Mind you, it is for most languages. People think it's an easy spec and it's not.
13:38 <@PerfDave> blech_: Then I shall write my own module to wrap libid3.so!
13:38 <@PerfDave> No, wait, who am I kidding? that would require effort.
13:38 <@PerfDave> Not to mention programming skills :)
13:39  * hex wonders if there is a libid.o file anywhere
13:39 <@blech_> PerfDave: mp3::id3lib not on your radar?
13:40 <@PerfDave> blech_: I haven't looked yet, I just mean to get around to rewrtiting my script so it doesnt' require id3v2 as a program
13:40 <@blech_> PerfDave: frankly, if you've got something that works, I'd leave it.
13:40 <@richardc> if that's what you mean use those words.  duh
13:41 <@PerfDave> richardc: Is that not what I said?
13:42 <@richardc> only on your second pass
13:42 <@PerfDave> 11:30 <@PerfDave> That reminds me, I should rewrite my MP3 organising script to use an ID3 tag munging module instead of shelling out to id3v2
13:42 <@richardc> 11:38 <@PerfDave> blech_: Then I shall write my own module to wrap libid3.so!
13:42 <@PerfDave> 11:37 <@blech_> PerfDave: probably not. The state of the art on Perl id3 tagging is fairly low.
13:43 <@blech_> Mea culpa; PerfDave made a statement which I read as a question.
13:43 <@blech_> http://search.cpan.org/author/THOGEE/tagged-0.40/Tag.pm
13:43  * PerfDave is looking at MP3::Tag ATM
13:43 <@blech_> http://search.cpan.org/author/LBROCARD/MP3-ID3Lib-0.12/ID3Lib.pm
13:44 <@PerfDave> Well, I say "looking at", I mean "failing to install"
13:44 <@blech_> Those are afaik the only two writing modules for id3v2.
13:45 <@PerfDave> There's an MP3::Tag::ID3v2
13:46 <@blech_> That's why I linked to MP3::Tag.
13:48 <@PerfDave> This looks nice and sane to use
13:49 <@blech_> It requires too much knowledge of the underlying naming for my liking.

13:52 <@DrHyde> Poirot and Tintin
13:52 <@davorg> you've never heard of Jacques Brel!
13:52 <@davorg> How about Herge then?
13:52 <@blech_> http://www.famousbelgians.net/
13:53 <@TeeJay> herge is french is he not ?
13:53 < rataxis> nope
13:53 < rataxis> nor was Brel.
13:53 < rataxis> Camus wasn't French either, afaik#
13:53 < rataxis> or Napoleon...
13:53 <+dipsy> napoleon is the short dead dude from the history review
13:53 <@TeeJay> but they all sound french
13:53 <@DrHyde> oh this is silly.  famousbelgians.net lists Mercator.  Who died in 1594.  Now, when was Belgium allegedly invented?
13:53  * CPAN upload: deltax-modules-3.06 by JSPICAK
13:53 < rataxis> camus was algerian, which to be fair was ruled by the french
13:53 <@blech_> http://www.famousbelgians.net/brel.htm
13:53 < rataxis> DrHyde : about 1860 wasn't it?
13:54 <@DrHyde> rataxis: summat like that
13:54 < rataxis> i think the dutch still say "belgium's not a country"
13:54 <@blech_> DrHyde: Shakespeare was listed as a Great Briton, and Great Britain didn't exist until 1707.
13:54 < rataxis> but then I know dutch people who shout "give me back my bicycle" at germans.
13:54 <@vorsprung> belgium is a state of mind
13:54 <@blech_> See also Elizabeth I.
13:54 <@blech_> And probably a couple of the others.
13:54 <@DrHyde> it's not.  it's a bay, with motorways on bridges.
13:54 < rataxis> blech_ : I think he was a Briton tho
13:54 <@blech_> rataxis: he was English.
13:54 < rataxis> and his work applies the Great.
13:55 < rataxis> didn't people use the word Briton before 1707?
13:55 <@TeeJay> yes briton itself is pretty old
13:55  * DrHyde points at Caesar
13:55 <@blech_> Not as a single political entity.
13:55 <@TeeJay> blech_: piffle
13:55 < rataxis> hmm. pub with perlmongers, or pub with sluts tonight...
13:55 <@blech_> Mercator is a European.
13:55 <@vorsprung> rataxis, brittainy
13:55 < rataxis> choices choices
13:55 <@blech_> Mercator was born in what is now Belgium.
13:55 <@vorsprung> is also a map projection
13:56 <@blech_> If Belgium was then ruled by, oh, Spain, does that make Mercator a Spaniard?
13:56 <@blech_> DrHyde seems to think so.
13:56 <@TeeJay> blech_: surely briton was unified by alfred the great when he united wessex and became kind of england
13:56 <@blech_> TeeJay: tell that to the Scots.
13:56 <@DrHyde> the who>
13:56 <@DrHyde> ?
13:56 <@TeeJay> ah yes - scotland is part of the uk - never really been briton
13:56 <@blech_> TeeJay: for someone who bangs on about fucking Kernow you have a remakably poor grasp of political identifications.
13:57 <@TeeJay> great britain is a victorian name surely
13:57 <@blech_> Where's Scotland if not on the island of Britain?
13:57 <@davorg> and part of the politcal entity called "Great Britain"
13:57 <@blech_> davorg: but not until 1707.
13:58 <@richardc> Oh Oh, I know this one.  It's behind the sofa
13:58 <@davorg> true, but Great Britain didn't exist before then did it?
13:58 <@vorsprung> dipsy, national anthem is <reply>cool britainnia, britainnia is so cool, take a trip, britains ever ever will be hip
13:58 <+dipsy> OK, vorsprung.
13:58 <@blech_> The island did, but I doubt people identified themselves as Britons.
13:58 <@davorg> what was the combination of England and Wales called pre-1707?
13:58 <@DrHyde> davorg: england
13:58 <@blech_> Just like I doubt people called themselves Europeans much before 195mumble.
13:59 <@vorsprung> I AM A CITIZEN OF THE ANCIENT ISLE OF ALBION
13:59 <@vorsprung> so there
13:59 <@vorsprung> so we are all albania
13:59 <@davorg> aren't we all trojans really (see Geoffery of Monmouth)
14:00 <@TeeJay> davorg: more likely mongrel celt/french/scandinavian
14:01 <@Dom2> davorg: I didn't think GoM was a very reliable source?
14:01 <@davorg> he's not. but it's fun
14:01  * Dom2 grins
14:01 <@DrHyde> and what kind of middle name is 'of'?
14:01 <@TeeJay> DrHyde: old fashioned ?
14:01 <@Dom2> DrHyde: the same as "van" in dutch I spose
14:01 <@davorg> TeeJay: according to GoM the original Celts were Tojans
14:01 <@davorg> Trojans
14:01 <@Dom2> davorg: they had american condoms in the middle ages?
14:02 <@davorg> no. this is _much_ earlier than the middle ages
14:02 <@DrHyde> silly ancient people, they should have sensible middle names like Richard
14:02 <@Dom2> DrHyde: I thought they went in for names like "SkullCrusher"
14:03 <@davorg> before Brutus turned up with his trojan hordes, albion was populated with giants who the trojans wiped out
14:03 <@blech_> InterCapping? How eighties.
14:03 <@davorg> (see Gog and Magog)
14:03 <@richardc> ah, how the monkeys dance
14:03 <@TeeJay> davorg: thats ireland
14:03 <@Dom2> blech_: StudlyCapsRulez
14:03 <@DrHyde> TeeJay: no its not
14:03 <@davorg> TeeJay: have you read GoM?
14:04 <@TeeJay> davorg: nope
14:04 < rataxis> um, the Celts were Trojans?
14:04 <@TeeJay> only hazy memory of gog and magog - thought it was ireland
14:04 < rataxis> how did they get from Turkey to northern europe then?
14:04  * Dom2  read "league of extraordinary gentlemen" last night
14:04 <@Dom2> rather good too
14:04 <@davorg> rataxis: in a boat
14:04 <@blech_> v1?
14:04 <@Dom2> yeah
14:04 <@davorg> or rather a lot of boats
14:04 <@blech_> v2 is coming along nicely too.
14:04 <@vorsprung> StUDlY uSeD To bE a sTaNdArD MeThOd of SiLlifiCaTion on alt.talk.bizarre
14:04 <@Dom2> blech_: Is v2 out as a graphic novel yet?
14:04 < rataxis> gog and magog are the giants of whom there are a pair of quite incredible statue/sculptures in the Guildhall.
14:05 <@davorg> rataxis: yep
14:05 <@TeeJay> rataxis: cool
14:05 < rataxis> my old school did /interminable/ prizegivings there, but the statuary is superb.
14:05 <@blech_> It's only up to issue 5, so no.
14:05 <@Dom2> ah, ok
14:05 <@Dom2> blech_: I saw the hardback edition in the shops yesterday, but at 55 quid, it's a bit much
14:05 <@davorg> the Trojans reached albion after many years of travelling and came ashore at Totnes
14:05 <@blech_> Dom2: 55 quid? Ouch. Is it gold-plated or something?
14:06 <@blech_> I'm sure usually ABC hardbacks are more like 20.
14:06 <@Dom2> blech_: I have no idea.  However, the indy reviewed it Saturday and said it was meant to be 75 quid, so I was kind of prepared
14:06  * davorg saw a trailer for the "LXG" film. They've changed all the characters
14:06 <@davorg> s/all/most of/
14:06 <@Dom2> blech_: I'll have to investigate what's so special about it anyway
14:06  * blech_ hopes LXG isn't as bad as From Hell was.
14:06 <@Dom2> davorg: really?  That sucks
14:06 <@richardc> naah, they've just made them jump around more
14:07 <@blech_> richardc: and swapped out a couple of folks.
14:07  * davorg liked "From Hell". It wasn't anything like the book, but i still enjoyed it.
14:07 <@Dom2> I liked From Hell, but I've never read the book :)
14:07 <@richardc> but as I said to muttley the other day, Alan Moore should die so he can spin in his grave
14:07 <@richardc> blech_: which ones?
14:07 <+dipsy> which ones are popular on here?
14:07 <@davorg> :)
14:07 <@blech_> richardc: think anyone will mind the spoilers?
14:07  * TeeJay dealt with some java generated xml with fuckedUpCaps
14:08 <@richardc> how is "charcter a is now b" a spoiler?
14:08 <@blech_> Mind you, this is 'spoilers as seen in trailers'.
14:08 <@blech_> Dunno. Just thought I'd ask.
14:08 <@blech_> Anyway, Dorian Gray is in it, as is Tom Sawyer.
14:08 <@richardc> odd
14:08 <@TeeJay> blech_: what ?
14:08 <@blech_> The latter is presumably a sop to the Americans.
14:08 < rataxis> blech_ : and they both die in the harry potter book.

14:09 <@richardc> TeeJay: go to the cinema, via a comics shop
14:09 <@richardc> get some culcha
14:09 < rataxis> TeeJay : sounds like an airport cxode
14:09 <@davorg> lxg is the film based on The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
14:09 < rataxis> -x
14:09 <@TeeJay> ok
14:09 < rataxis> dipsy metar lxg
14:09 <+dipsy> rataxis: I can't find any observations for KLXG.
14:09 < rataxis> bah
14:10 <@blech_> The most recent trailer in the UK just went "The League" with an ominous pause, probably because they thought people were getting confused with the LoG.
14:11 <@davorg> heh :)
14:11 < rataxis> oh, isn't LXG the LoG film?
14:11  * rataxis is confused, now
14:11 <@blech_> LoG- silly Northern comedy
14:11 <@aef> Is "Mwhahaha, I will crush him like a bug!" a good attitude to have when going into interview someone? I've just seen this guy's attempt at our Perl test...
14:11 <@blech_> LXG- fictional characters fight crime
14:11 < rataxis> oh
14:11 < rataxis> how boring.
14:12 <@davorg> no. both very good.
14:12 <@blech_> Oh, it's not.
14:12 < rataxis> I'd rather see piggyfaces on film.
14:12 < rataxis> is there an LoG film coming?
14:12 <@vorsprung> aef, focus on the few things he has got right
14:12 <@Kake> Yay, wonderful interview.
14:12 <@davorg> Kake: excellent. where? who?
14:12 <+dipsy> excellent. where are you getting the location data from?
14:12 <@vorsprung> aef, but really isn't that what tests are for?
14:12 <@aef> vorsprung: I'm concerned about the stuff he seems to be BSing about though, comparing his test to his CV.
14:13 <@Kake> T&D Limitless, Wandsworth, Oracle/Perl/webthing
14:13 <@richardc> aef: sure, just as long as you manage to completely crush them.  don't leave someone angry and vowing revenge
14:13 <@aef> richardc: Bah :)
14:13 <@Kake> I liked them, they liked me, they're only interviewing 5 people altogether and that's all today - they're hoping to let me know before tomorrow.
14:13 <@Dom2> richardc++ # true evil genius at work
14:13 < rataxis> kake!
14:13 <@aef> No, I want to see if this guy really is completely BSing or just had a bad test.
14:13 < rataxis> good luck :)
14:13 <@Kake> rataxis, one word: "cashback".
14:13 <@aef> Kake: Just had it? How'd it go?
14:13 <@aef> Cashback?
14:13 <+dipsy> Cashback is an essential tool for the broke
14:14 <@vorsprung> aef, so you are going to have to quiz him about his answers
14:14 <@davorg> oh. i know people at limitless i think
14:14 <@Kake> It's really quite easy to get to from my place, too.
14:14 <@Dom2> short commutes are a win
14:14 <@aef> vorsprung: I'll ask him a few new ones too. Our test only covers Perl, this guy also puts "Database Design" as one of his top key skills.
14:14 <@vorsprung> aef, "why did you say xyz when it is clearly abc?"
14:14 <@bob> Kake: bus?
14:14 <+dipsy> i heard bus was big and red or what comes in groups after you wait ages for one or great or good for seeing town or goes from the end of Kake's street rather than from 20 minutes' walk away or strictly for the peasents or ok, as long as you arent in a hurry or summonable with a bus stop and a cigarette
14:15 <@yoda> Kake: what was this job for?
14:15 <@Kake> bob: Yup, walk through Fulham Cemetery, grab the 295 on Dawes Road, train from Clapham Junction.
14:15 <@aef> vorsprung: Mmm.
14:15 <@Kake> yoda: T&D Limitless, Wandsworth, Oracle/Perl/webthing
14:15 <@yoda> (housing associations)--
14:15 <@yoda> Kake: cool
14:15 <@vorsprung> aef, oh i dunno I am crap at interviewing :)
14:16 <@davorg> Kake: hey. that's in Balham
14:16  * PerfDave plugs grubstreet on his LJ, just for Kake (and others)
14:16 <@davorg> or, at least, very close to it
14:16 <@aef> vorsprung: I guess I'm non-confrontational in that sense. I don't like to say "you're wrong", I prefer to ask more questions which shows they don't really know it, or shows that they must have been wrong.
14:16 <@vorsprung> aef, i tend to hire people I like with fatal consequences :)
14:17 <@yoda> housing association: "the piece of worktop wasn't there when you moved in? sorry, doesn't count as a repair then. contact your site manager"     site manager: "you need to contact them about that? oh, you did? well email me about it and i'll see what i can do"
14:17 <@vorsprung> aef, if you make people feel awkward then the interview is less effective
14:17 <@yoda> with site managers response toned down a bit
14:17 <@vorsprung> aef, but if they don't know perl and they have to...then there isn't any way around that :)
14:17 <@aef> vorsprung: Oh, I just don't like anyone :)
14:18 <@aef> vorsprung: Yes, but if they really don't know the stuff they claim on the CV, I don't really mind making them awkward.
14:18 <@aef> vorsprung: If they say "I don't know that, but I'd look it up in...", that's often good. And if they say they don't know I'll ask them where they'd look.
14:18 <@aef> vorsprung: But I'm not keen on people who try to bluff.
14:19 <@blech_> FFS, the WMD 404 has gone viral again.
14:19 <@Greg> not even well educated bluffing?
14:19 -!- vorsprung [vorsprung@shpt-3e353c3e.pool.mediaWays.net] has quit [leaving]
14:20 <@PerfDave> blech_: I think because it now shoews up on "I Feel Lucky". It's like the french military victory thing
14:20 <@blech_> PerfDave: yes. Doesn't stop it annoying the fuck out of me though.
14:21 <@PerfDave> blech_: Read my blog instead, I didn't link to it ;)
14:24 <@Kake> I see that use.perl continues its slide towards livejournalness.
14:25  * Shevek never read use.perl and never reads lj, so that's fine.
14:26  * aef &
14:26 <@PerfDave> "Which CPAN module are YOU?"
14:26  * Shevek is Acme::Magpie.

14:26 <@Shevek> I probably couldn't, off the top of my head.
14:27 <@Shevek> I mean, I have better things to do with my time than learn who wrote each module.
14:27 <@PerfDave> "Which Buffy character and p5p member are YOU?"
14:27 <@Shevek> I'm quite clearly Anya, and what is p5p?
14:27 <@Shevek> I mean, "Who is Anya?"
14:27 <@Shevek> I mean, "What's buffy?"
14:28  * Shevek looks embarassed.

14:30 <@Greg> what they need such good eyesight for anyway?
14:30 <@Dom2> Greg: isn't that a WWII urban legend?
14:31 < rataxis> Greg : to see underground
14:31 <@Shevek> rataxis: I'm not actually sure. I think she's the evil incompetent witch.
14:32 <@richardc> Greg: so they can train to be Top Gun pilots
14:32 < rataxis> iirc carotene /does/ have someminor effect on good eyesight
14:32 < rataxis> Shevek : no, that's my boss

14:33 <@Trelane> I'd like to be Xander, I'd prefer to be myself on p5p (one day), and DBD::SQLite and URI::Find
14:34 < rataxis> is there any truth in the story that the romantic crap in top gun (maverick and ice playing piano in the bar with their girlfriends, the motorbike rides, etc) were added after original filming because test audiences hated the film?
14:34 < rataxis> i've heard it a few times ..
14:34 <@Dom2> I've never seen top gun
14:34 <@Dom2> so I have no idea
14:34 < rataxis> Trelane : I think I'd like to be Angel. 
14:35 < rataxis> and I'd change my surname to Tube-Station
14:35 <@PerfDave> Angel Tube Station has far more depth than the Buffy character.
14:36 <@blech_> Longest single run escalator on the system.
14:36 < rataxis> so i thought, but isn't Holborn a good bit longer?
14:36 <@Trelane> rataxis: imdb says 'The love scene between Tom Cruise and Kelly McGillis was filmed after the movie's initial release. Moviegoers complained that there was no love scene, so the company obliged'

14:38 <@blech_> 'Angel station has the longest 60m (197 ft) escalators in western Europe, which take 80 seconds to carry passengers up or down the 27.5 m (90 ft) drop '
14:38 <@blech_> More like 30s if you run up.

14:38 <@Dom2> blech_: I always hated going up the stairs at covent garden
14:39 <@Dom2> blech_: But then I was a fool for doing so and should have waited for the lfts
14:39 <@Trelane> dear god that scene on the beach is terrible
14:39 <@Magnus> this one time
14:39 <@muttley> Trelane: that whole script is pretty cheesy
14:39 <@Magnus> we were going up the stairs at Covent Garden
14:39 <@muttley> apparently most early scripts are
14:39 <@Magnus> and my gay linguist friend Rob accosted some dutch tourists
14:39 <@Magnus> so I was lumbered carrying their pushchair
14:39 <@muttley> in fact, most scripts sound pretty bad when you read them 
14:39 <@Magnus> while he talked to them
14:39 <@muttley> can somebody bounce pobitch to simon@geekflat.org?
14:40 <@Dom2> Magnus: gay linguist?
14:40 <@Magnus> bounced
14:41 <@Magnus> Trelane: are you saying that Top Gun went into about a zillion cinemas, and then they added a scene?
14:41 <@Magnus> I could believe that it went to a test audience
14:41 <@Greg> shit, top gun without the tom/kelly love seen, that would of been like 11 out of 10 on the gay movie scale
14:41 <@Magnus> Dom2: homeosexual. studied modern languages.
14:42 <@Dom2> Magnus: I am aware of that.  It just seemed an odd combination and far too close to a poor pun

14:46 <@bob> davorg: as if rutger woudl ever win an oscar
14:46 <@davorg> true
14:46 <@TeeJay> hmm that means downloading, fucking with and uploading again
14:47 <@Dom2> the trouble is that "rutger" sounds too similiar to "roentgen", so every kept mistaking him for a physical unit.
14:47 <@davorg> is roentgen a physical unit? i thought it was a type of radiation.
14:48 <@davorg> or is is a measure of radiation?

15:06 <@davorg> DrHyde: but SpamAssassin doesn't catch most of them

15:06 <@blech_> (Lady Archer)-- # almost as fucking awful as her husband
15:06 <@davorg> Shevek: yes. many.
15:07 <@Dom2> blech_: The trouble is that she doesn't look as attractive as him

15:07 <@DrHyde> 359 attempts to deliver to randombollocks@myserver in the past 48 hours
15:08 <@Dom2> DrHyde: postfix blocks most of those for me.

15:15 <@davorg> blech_: no. where's that?
15:16 <@blech_> davorg: where the old one was, unsurprisingly.
15:16 <@blech_> They've opened the new pedestrianised northern part.
15:16 <@Greg> i dont like it
15:16 <@davorg> ah. so it's the old Trafalgar Sq, but with some changes :)
15:16  * Greg waits for blech's disagreement
15:16 <@blech_> I haven't been there yet. I like the idea though.
15:17 <@Greg> yeah, but the new one is ugly 
15:17 <@Greg> it just doesnt look the same
15:17 <@blech_> At least you can cut across it without dodging insane cab drivers.

15:17 <@muttley> Right, that's me all registered properly for YAPC::Europe

15:18  * Greg ponders if he is remembering picadilly circus wrongly
15:18 <@davorg> no. just the one.
15:18 <@Greg> ah true
15:18 <@davorg> i think you're confused
15:18 <@Greg> there isnt a roundabout there 
15:18  * Greg nods
15:18 <@Greg> yip, it doesnt take much
15:18 <@davorg> it's just a five-way junction now
15:19 <@Greg> silly old me thinking a roundabout might be handy for a 5 way junction ;-)
15:19 <@davorg> :)
15:19 <@davorg> it used to be. as i said.
15:19 <@richardc> that's crazy talk
15:19 <@blech_> It still works. It's just a larger one way system now.
15:19 <@blech_> You'd have to be some sort of crazy man to want to drive in Central London anyway, so fuck 'em.
15:20 <@davorg> but the roads were constantly blocked by bloody tourists trying to get into the centre to have their pictures taken with the angel of christian charity

15:51 <@Greg> anyone got any recommendations for 200 quid digital camera?
15:51 < Magnus> IXUS
15:51 <@blech_> Don't bother, go the extra mile for a 300 quid one.
15:52 <@Greg> i'd like 2+Mega pixels, and maybe being able to take short 1 minute movies
15:52 <@Greg> at a reasonable fps
15:52 < Magnus> IXUS
15:52 <@davorg> my Canon Powershot A40 does all that
15:52 <@Greg> the IXUS 400 looks great but is too much
15:53 <@davorg> and was about £200 iirc
15:53 <@blech_> How much is a v3 these days?
15:53 <@Greg> 256
15:53 < Magnus> 256 from amazon
15:53 < Magnus> if only we knew people at Canon who could get 40% off
15:54 <@Greg> what is the battery life on ixus' 
15:54 < Magnus> good enough, but buy 2 spare batteries at £19 each
15:54 <@blech_> I get about a week of medium/heavy usage.
15:54 <@blech_> I think I took nearly 140 photos and some movies at Glastonbury before I had to swap batteries, and I might have managed without, just.
15:55 <@Greg> ok thanks for the advice peeps, i'm now pondering the various IXUS options
15:55 <@blech_> Thinking about it, some of the larger-bodied Canon cameras will be about as good, but cheaper.
15:56 <@blech_> You do pay for the size.
15:56 < Magnus> blech_: that's pretty good
15:56 < Magnus> mine takes about 100 photos before new battery
15:56 < Magnus> about 40 if you use the LCD viewfinder
15:56 <@Ranguard> Greg: sony have nice little ones for about that
15:56 < Magnus> and that's without flash
15:56 < Magnus> size is important
15:56 < Magnus> IXUS
15:56 <@blech_> Magnus: I seem to take more care with batteries than others.
15:57 < Magnus> blech_: me too
15:57 < Magnus> because in the past they have always run out just at that crucial Kodak moment
15:57 <@blech_> The Ixus does have terrible battery information. It warns you about 10 photos before it dies, and not a peep until there.
15:58  * Ranguard heads to meeting for the afternoon
15:58 <@Ranguard> Greg: http://products.sony.co.uk/productdetail.asp?id=8_60_3796
15:58 -!- Ranguard is now known as RanAway
15:59 < Magnus> the trouble with the Sony is that it uses memory stick wank
16:00 <@davorg> what's wrong with memory stick?
16:00 <@davorg> other than it being proprietary?
16:01 < Magnus> it's gay
16:01 < Magnus> some memory sticks have copyright protection stuff on them
16:01 <@Dom2> it is annoyingly expensive
16:01 <@Dom2> compared to CF et al
16:01 <@davorg> Magnus: yeah. the white one. i  don't use those.
16:02 <@davorg> and i have no objection to using homsexual technology
16:02 <@Dom2> davorg: So you use strict too :)
16:02 < Magnus> davorg: but would you let your (step)kids use it?
16:02 <@davorg> of course :)
16:02 <@davorg> why not
16:02 <@Dom2> actually, if anything is homosexual technology, it's got to be UFS and sendmail
16:03 <@Dom2> they're both implemented by known homosexuals
16:03 <@TeeJay> or pre OSX mac os
16:03 <@TeeJay> that is *so* gay
16:03 <@Dom2> "sendmail isn't gay, but it's author is" :)
16:03 <@Greg> Dom2: i heard that they mess with the bits so that if you read too much mail sent by sendmail you can catch gayness

16:08 <@muttley> Greg - I'd cheerfully kill to get you into this job
16:08 <@muttley> curse you being happily employed
16:09 <@davorg> muttley: i'm not :)
16:09 <@Greg> on a holistic note, is the old truman brewery anywhere near state51? 
16:09 <@davorg> Greg: yes
16:09 <@muttley> Greg: yes. Just down brick lane
16:09 <@muttley> Greg: why, are you off to Espotting?
16:09 <@Greg> yarr
16:09 <@Greg> going to sort out this crap for once and for all
16:09 <@muttley> me++ # guessing of clients merely by location
16:10 <@muttley> Greg: give them a good LARTing for me aswell. I'm fed up of this shit too
16:10 <@Greg> it shall all go away RSN

16:11 <@Greg> not in a top gun way then ;-)

16:13 <@TeeJay> actually E1 would make a great place for a game of paintball
16:14 <@Greg> i'd love to do LARP in the underground
16:14 <@Greg> some sort of combat simulation
16:14 <@TeeJay> or play laser tag in Liverpool street station
16:14 <@Greg> laser tag would work
16:14 <@TeeJay> yup
16:14 <@TeeJay> less upset bystanders
16:14 -!- megas [joaop@194.65.5.235] has quit [Read error: 0 (Success)]
16:15 <@Greg> but its the roleplaying aspects of creeping along the empty tunnels, kicking the mice that would appeal
16:15 <@Greg> having to be silent as you tried to retake a tube station held by terrorists
16:15 <@TeeJay> last man standing - last person to remain in the station without being arrested
16:16  * CPAN upload: WWW-SearchBroker-0.07 by NATE
16:16 <@Dom2> Greg: Why on earth would terrorists hold up a tube station?
16:16 <@Dom2> Greg: Would anybody notice anything different from usual?
16:16 <@Dom2> Greg: Ok, "mind the gap" might be a little more offensive
16:17 <@Trelane> anyone got any advice on installing mod_perl on debian?
16:17 <@TeeJay> how much would it cost to hire a van (to escape the police) and some laser tag equipment for the day ?
16:18  * CPAN upload: Language-Homespring-Visualise-GraphViz-0.01 by IAMCAL
16:18 <@Dom2> Trelane: Doesn't it come with it?
16:18 <@Trelane> nope, debian doesn't come with anything much
16:18 <@hex> How much would Faraday cage steel mesh suits cost to protect you from the inevitable death by electric shock from the rails?
16:18 <@Trelane> do I just apt-get it, or is this bad and wrong?
16:18 <@Trelane> I'm not worried about performance - I'm testing atm
16:18 <@blech_> apt-get worked for me on hunter.
16:19 <@TeeJay> is it -F or -f to force cvs into doing something against its will
16:19 <@Trelane> I should probably update tthis laptop too
16:19 <@Dom2> Trelane: apt-get should do the trick then
16:19 <@Greg> Dom2: because a VIP, maybe a politician was opening it, and they tried to kidnap him, but the police surrounded the station to carry out negotiations, they send in the special forces unit, which owuld be the roleplaying group
16:20 <@Trelane> just have terrorists try and escape into the underground
16:20 <@Trelane> and then have it sealed off
16:20 <@Dom2> Greg: Sounds like an average rush hour to me
16:20 <@Trelane> that would be good enough reason for them to be there
16:20 <@Greg> Trelane: its more fun if they hold the tube station, then you get to attack from the rail track
16:20 <@Greg> into the light of the platform
16:21 <@Dom2> Hmmm, you could call it terror tube, just like the first Nemesis strip
16:21 <@hex> dipsy: calthorpe arms?
16:21 <+dipsy> it has been said that calthorpe arms is at http://london.pm.org/meetings/locations/calthorpe.html
16:21 <@Greg> right all we need to buy is some guns with blanks, some laser simulating things, some combat and terrorist gear and of course a tube station
16:21 <@hex> no, dipsy, calthorpe arms is at http://xrl.us/calthorpe
16:21  * Trelane apt-get upgrades
16:21 <+dipsy> okay, hex.
16:21 <@Trelane> whee - 203MBs
16:21 <@Greg> Dom2: Creedo!
16:22 <@Trelane> go go fast internet connection
16:22  * Dom2 grins
16:23 <@Trelane> I don't like the idea of encouraging the general populace to think of tube stations as terrorist targets however
16:23 <@Trelane> even if it is for fun and games
16:24 <@TeeJay> Trelane: surely they do already
16:24 <@blech_> no, dipsy, calthorpe arms is at http://london.pm.org/meetings/locations/calthorpe.html
16:24 <+dipsy> okay, blech_.
16:24 <@Trelane> I think you'll find that the genreal populace belive whatever the daily mail tells them to
16:24 <@TeeJay> what with them being rather good targets just after the houses of parliament and nuclear power stations
16:24 <@Trelane> nah, they're better tagets
16:24 <@Trelane> they have more 'that could have been me' feel to them
16:25 <@Trelane> and virtually no security measures
16:25 <@TeeJay> harder to hit with hijacked planes or car bombs
16:25 <@hex> blech_: OK, sorry.
16:25 <@Dom2> terrorism++ # beats working
16:25 <@blech_> hex: just didn't see any advantage in the shorter form.
16:25 <@hex> blech_: Easier for me to remember. :)
16:26 <@Trelane> why is there a half naked[1] mermade bottle opener on my desk?
16:26 <@Trelane> not that I object you understand, but enquiring minds want to know
16:26 <@Trelane> [1] okay, fully naked, as sully naked as mermaids get
16:27 <@hex> blech_: compare and contrast http://xrl.us/cittie and http://xrl.us/penderel
16:27 < Magnus> orange are mental
16:27 <@Trelane> what have they gone done now
16:28 < Magnus> in order to get 5 free texts a day
16:28 < Magnus> I have to buy a voucher for £19.99
16:28 < Magnus> they will courier it to me
16:28 < Magnus> and I will dial a number to activate it
16:28 <@Trelane> you know I had an idea
16:29 <@Trelane> do text messages have copyright?
16:29 < Magnus> how do you mean
16:29 <@Trelane> can I forward any text message I get legally?
16:29 <@blech_> hex: http://london.pm.org/meetings/locations/ ?
16:30 <@Trelane> because I was wondering if you could do cut price deals on other people's sms services.  For example, I think arsenals goal alert sms is too expensive
16:30 <@hex> blech_: *shrug* This way I can memorise the URLs easily. Also http://xrl.us/newworld , http://xrl.us/porterhouse
16:30 <@Trelane> but if I was to subscribe and then forward this onto five other people who paid me
16:30 <@blech_> hex: I don't need to memorise the totality. I know I can get an index and then copy and paste them.
16:30 <@Trelane> hex: isn't this what grubstreet is for
16:31 <@Trelane> oh wait, that's got a shit url too
16:31 <@hex> blech_: If it works for you...
16:31 <@blech_> hex: very well, thanks.
16:31 <@hex> http://openguides.org/london/?Penderel's_Oak,_WC1V_7HP isn't very catchy...
16:32 <@Trelane> then fix it dear hex, then fix it
16:32 <@hex> Trelane: suggest a better naming scheme
16:32 <@Trelane> hex: allow people to create nicknames for urls
16:32 <@hex> <name> <postcode> guarantees uniqueness
16:33 <@hex> Trelane: that's someone else's wheel, already extensively reinvented
16:33 <@Trelane> so allow openguides.org/penderel
16:33 <@hex> Nah, leads to problems.
16:33 <@richardc> what kind of problems?
16:33 <@hex> That issue has a convenient SEP field around it.
16:33 <@Trelane> oh okay.  Let everyone create a hundred random urls to the place that can't be shared and organised
16:34 <@hex> richardc: that there is no unique occurrence of "Penderel".
16:34  * Trelane accueses hex of false lazyness
16:34 <@Trelane> hex: they're nicknames.  first come first served
16:34 <@richardc> hex: at which point you show a list of the matches
16:34 <@Trelane> no no no
16:34  * blech_ still wonders what the problem is.
16:34 <@hex> richardc: that's not what Trelane was suggesting
16:34 <@Trelane> you create nicknames that point to real unqiue urls
16:35 <@hex> richardc: I actually quite like that approach, and I believe we're thinking of it for a future OG release
16:35 <@richardc> hex: I noticed that I was the person typing
16:35 <@Trelane> richardc: no I posses you
16:35 <@hex> richardc: heh
16:35  * Trelane makes richardc poke himself in the eye
16:35 <@richardc> you foul creature
16:36 <@hex> Trelane: if someone would like to write a plugin for nicknames, sure. It's not going to be in the OG core.
16:37  * hex is pleased to discover that the first US OpenGuide will be appearing shortly
16:37  * DrHyde 's database is making "urgh" noises
16:37  * Trelane gives up trying to help hex
16:38 <@Trelane> all I'm suggesting is that maybe for a guide system it might be nice to have urls that people could, you know, type into emails
16:39 <@blech_> http://openguides.org/london/?Calthorpe_Arms,_WC1X_8JR doesn't fit in 80 chars?
16:39 <@bob> Trelane: you have heard of cut n paste right
16:39 <@richardc> naah.  fuck the users
16:39 <@blech_> What sort of freaky world do you live in?
16:39 <@blech_> I doubt it's memorisable, but it's one search box from discovery.
16:39 <@Trelane> I live in a freaky world where normal people don't understand cut and paste
16:40 <@blech_> Normal people don't swap URLs either.
16:40 -!- music2 [~moranb@137.37.dhcp.lse.ac.uk] has joined #london.pm

16:41 <@Greg> just double checking
16:41 <@Greg> a class C network is
16:41 <@blech_> Uh? They don't understand pasting URLs but they know how to use URL shortening services?
16:41 <@Greg> NNN.NNN.NNN.*
16:41 <@Greg> ?
16:41 < Magnus> yeah
16:41 < Magnus> 256 addresses
16:41 <@gellyfish> scribot: http://www.pimphats.com
16:42 <@blech_> Why do people leave trailing slashes off URLs?
16:42 < Magnus> 'cos they aren't needed
16:42 <@davorg> they like the extra traffic it creates?
16:42 < Magnus> I just got a 10' x 2' banner printed and put it up in the town center
16:42 <@richardc> rule 2
16:43 <@gellyfish> no slash required after the host if no local path specified
16:43 < Magnus> do you think it reads http://www.bradfordonavon.com/
16:43 < Magnus> no, it reads 'bradfordonavon.com'
16:43 <@richardc> no, it reads 'backwater'
16:43 < Magnus> see if I'd stuck to the RFC it would look wank.
16:43 <@Trelane> photo! photo!
16:43 <@davorg> so your server will need to respnd to twice the number of requests
16:44 <@davorg> good for getting the stats up :)
16:44 < Magnus> eh?
16:44 < Magnus> why do you say that
16:44 <@richardc> davorg: um.  don't you put images in your pages?
16:44 < Magnus> it doesn't redirect to www. f that's what you think
16:45 <@TeeJay> surely www. is just an alias to domain.com
16:45 <@davorg> it's not the www. that casues two hits, it's missing off the / from the end
16:45 <@davorg> richardc: rarely
16:46 <@Trelane> davorg: huh?  nope...not at top level.  The browser puts the / in
16:46 <@davorg> after getting a 403 from the server surely
16:46 <@Trelane> no
16:46 <@richardc> no
16:46 <@Trelane> you can't say 'GET '
16:46 < Magnus> davorg: it actually doesn't anyway
16:46 <@Trelane> you have to say 'GET /'
16:47 < Magnus> at least only one turns up in the logs
16:47 <@richardc> you get a 403 for /foo when it's /foo/
16:47 < Magnus> and then about 50 images
16:47 <@davorg> oh. ok.
16:47  * davorg sits corrected
16:47 < Magnus> HAHA
16:47 < Magnus> when will you learn
16:47 <@davorg> what do i know. fucking inetrweb. bloody waste of time anyway...
16:48 < Magnus> :)
16:48 <@Trelane> I bored.  Be updated already computer!
16:48 < Magnus> I reckon we've had 5 extra hits a day from that banner
16:48 < Magnus> so far
16:48 < Magnus> actually more like 10
16:48 < Magnus> has anyone seen the front page today
16:49 < Magnus> 'Bradford Boys Denied Beavers' a stroke of genius, I think
16:50 <@gellyfish> ???
16:50 < Magnus> bradfordonavon.com
16:50 <+dipsy> bradfordonavon.com is very nearly ready
16:50 <@Greg> is bradford on avon near nuneaton and that sort of place?
16:51 < Magnus> outside the M25, that's right.
16:51 <@davorg> notlondon then
16:51 <@davorg> and therefore uninteresting
16:51 < Magnus> hmm
16:51 <@Greg> i really don't know where BoA is
16:51 < Magnus> you surely don't really think this
16:51 <@TeeJay> Magnus: what cms do you use ?
16:51 <@Greg> remember i've only moved to england 3~5 years ago

16:52 <@TeeJay> feh
16:52 < Magnus> Greg: do you know where Bristol and Bath are?
16:52 <@Greg> nope
16:52 <@Greg> and i'm not trolling
16:52 < Magnus> are you kidding
16:52 <@Greg> i know where peterborough is
16:52 <@TeeJay> Greg: westbury then ?
16:52 <@Greg> and york
16:52 <@davorg> Greg: they are west of here
16:52 <@Greg> and newcastle
16:52 <@Greg> i know where brighton is
16:52 <@davorg> near the west coast
16:52 <@Greg> ah
16:52 <@TeeJay> its quite close to the big white horse in wiltshire
16:52 <@Greg> liverpool direction?
16:52 <@davorg> south of that
16:52 <@TeeJay> at least closer than to bristol
16:52 <@Greg> i went to nuneaton recently
16:53 <@Greg> i think it was near coventry
16:53  * Greg can tell you were lots of towns/cities in northern ireland and scotland are
16:53 <@Greg> but not england
16:53 <@Greg> living in london gives you a very london centric view of things
16:53 < Magnus> http://makeashorterlink.com/?S5FB12325 # for greg
16:53 < Magnus> the circle shows Bradford on Avon
16:54 <@Greg> cool
16:54 <@Greg> i always thought Bath was near Welwyn Garden City
16:54 <@davorg> see. west. and near the coast
16:55 <@Greg> hmmm
16:55 <@DrHyde> bradford isn't on the avon
16:55 <@Greg> i shall buy a map of the uk this weekend and pin it up
16:55 <@DrHyde> it's next to leeds, and full of curry
16:55 <@blech_> musicbrainz-- # poorly documented, insane query format
16:55 <@Greg> so where is the avon?
16:55 <@davorg> DrHyde: differnet bradford i think
16:55 <@davorg> that's another problem with notlondon. they reuse names.
16:55 <@Greg> ah
16:56 <@Greg> i think i see the root of the problem here
16:56 <@davorg> it's all very confusing
16:56 <@Greg> is there multiple bradfords
16:56 <@DrHyde> quite. there's several avons
16:56 <@Greg> or multiple avons
16:56 <@TeeJay> canada-- # has another cornwall leading to confusion
16:56 <@davorg> Greg: both
16:56 <@Greg> AH CURSE YOU ENGLAND!
16:56 <@blech_> TeeJay: only for stupid people. And people who care about Cornwall.
16:56 <@Greg> is there an avon near nuneaton/coventry
16:56 <@DrHyde> you don't get multiple sydenhams, or westminsters, or peckhams
16:56 <@blech_> Actually, isn't that an overlapping set?
16:56 <@richardc> it's all find as long as you stay nicely within the m25
16:56 <@TeeJay> but only one bradford is on an avon
16:57 <@davorg> TeeJay: yeah, but you can't rely on coincidences like that
16:57 <@Greg> i like brighton, go south from london, stop when it gets wet
16:57 <@bob> Greg: south onthe right road
16:57 <@TeeJay> Greg: surely south south west
16:57 <@TeeJay> straight south will take you to some awful beach in kent
16:57 <@Greg> ok, i'm definetly getting a map of the UK and pinning it up this weekend
16:58 <@TeeJay> just like going straight north will take you to a marsh in northumbria rather than scotland
16:58 <@Greg> davorg/blech: do people in places like bath, swindon, tunbridge wells, bedford, kidderminster realise how unimportant they are?
16:59 <@davorg> Greg: possibly
16:59  * gellyfish pokes Greg with a stick
16:59 < Magnus> Greg: did you really think bath was near welwyn
16:59 < Magnus> you're being silly, right?
16:59 <@Greg> Magnus: nope
16:59 <@Greg> but i was up in nuneaton/conventry direction recently and saw a sign for somewhere on avon and i thought it might have been near there
16:59 < Magnus> gosh.
17:00 < Magnus> stratford
17:00 <@Greg> yarr
17:00 < Magnus> there are many avons
17:00 <@Greg> i did not know this
17:00 < Magnus> for avon in anglo saxon means 'river'
17:00 <@Greg> ah
17:00 <@TeeJay> don't both avons feed the severn tho
17:00 <@TeeJay> which is a little confusing
17:00 <@Greg> Magnus: but then again you can't tell me where dundee, aberdeen, falkirk, stirling, etc are from the top of your head
17:00 <@davorg> see "stratford" is another problem. stratford is in east London
17:00 <@TeeJay> davorg: but nobody goes there so we can ignore it
17:01 <@bob> Greg: inscotland
17:01 <@Greg> the scary thing is i've been to stratford upon avon and can't remember when
17:01 <@DrHyde> to get to dundee, you go north, then north a bit more, and finally you go north.
17:01 <@TeeJay> in fact life on the whole is better if you pretend that east london doesn't exist
17:01 <@Greg> i think it was when i was visiting my uncle years and years ago
17:01 <@DrHyde> see, i know scottish jography!
17:01 <@Greg> DrHyde: where is aviemore
17:02  * muttley liked Dundee
17:02 <@richardc> north
17:02 <@davorg> TeeJay: east london is alright. it's got character.
17:02 < Magnus> Greg: dundee = north west
17:02 < Magnus> falkirk = west
17:02 <@davorg> Greg: Aviemore is newar Fort William
17:02 < Magnus> stirling = middling
17:02 <@Greg> Magnus: dundee = east
17:02 <@Greg> falkirk = middle
17:02 < Magnus> I meant east
17:02 < Magnus> I meant middle
17:02 <@blech_> Argh fuck this doesn't make ANY FUCKING SENSE>
17:02 <@muttley> davorg: where character means "drug dealers and poverty"
17:02 <@Greg> stirling is middle of central belt near falkir
17:02 <@blech_> It tells you how to do queries but not lookups.
17:02 <@Greg> dundee is up the coast on the east from edinburgh

17:06 < Magnus> did everyone die?
17:06 <@muttley> I woke up again in Montrose and managed to catch the last train back to Dundee.
17:06 <@Greg> you can have a lot of fun in edinburgh
17:06 < Magnus> edinburgh++ # festival

17:07 < Magnus> isn't Montrose in france?
17:07 <@Greg> well its a capital city as well
17:07 <@muttley> plus now I have the chance to stay in the Whisky Society flat above the tasting rooms
17:07 <@Greg> muttley: but thats in leith

17:07 <+dipsy> OK, Trelane.

17:08 <@gellyfish> she doesn't know for instance my mother's maiden name

18:03 <@davorg> itsn't that what Dave Winer is for?
18:03 <@hex> blech_: apparently there's been some kerfuffle over the last week, largely due to this article by Tim Bray: http://tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/06/23/SamsPie#davewiner
18:03 <@davorg> oh. he's been threatening Aaron
18:03 <@hex> Winer describes him as saying "awful things" about him; I don't see that at all.
18:03 <@Greg> you get better value opinions on this channel than reading dave winer
18:03 <@hex> [[  Dave Winer has done a tremendous amount of work on RSS and invented important parts of it and deserves a huge amount of credit for getting us as far as we have. However, just looking around, I observe that there are many people and organizations who seem unable to maintain a good working relationship with Dave.
18:03 <@hex> I regularly get pissed-off at Dave but I really truly do think he's trying to Do The Right Thing; but there are many people out there who can't get past being pissed off. This is what life is like. ]]
18:03 <@davorg> hex: i thought Bray had put it all very politely
18:04 <@hex> davorg: exactly.
18:04 <@hex> This just contributes to my growing awareness of how much of a fucking loon Winer is.
18:05 <@davorg> hex: ah, but he has this heart complaint you see :)
18:05 <@hex> "Echo"? Oh, god.
18:05 <@davorg> so he can't take any stress

18:23 < rataxis> hullo mstevens 
18:24  * mstevens had nice japanese food yesterday
18:25 <@vorsprung> I gave up smoking with a reasonable success rate twice
18:25 < rataxis> mstevens : I wish I could've come. I now have money, but ATMs were being shitty.
18:25 <@vorsprung> first time I grew my own grass and just smoked that for several months.  Then when it ran out, I didn't want to smoke tabs

18:27 <@vorsprung> second time I'd become a dad and wanted to give up so I didn't ever smoke in front of my kid.  I also switched jobs and told them I was a non smoker
18:27 <@coraline> translation question: tabs?
18:28 <@vorsprung> tabs == tabacco cigarettes
18:28 <@coraline> ah.
18:28 <@vorsprung> it's a north-west expression
18:29 <@coraline> north-west.. uk?
18:29 <@music2> What do nonsmokers usually die of?
18:29 <@coraline> (heh)
18:29 <@Greg> music2: 'old age'/strokes/heart attacks/cancer
18:29 <@music2> Is it nicer?
18:29 <@vorsprung> but a lot of people started saying it after it was in Viz comic, "sid the sexist" was always smoking tabs and shaggin' birds
18:29 <@Greg> trust me most things are nicer than lung cancer
18:29 <@coraline> heh
18:29 <@Greg> lung cancer is not a nice thing at all
18:29 <@music2> Like alzheimer's?
18:30 <@Greg> i'd suggest LC is worse
18:30 <@Magnus> the point is they die a lot later and with more slowly deteriorating health
18:30 <@music2> mortality-- # What's the use?
18:30 <@Magnus> seeing my grandad spend the last five years of his life in a chair with a mask on his face was enough to put me off smoking
18:30 <@Magnus> people have to be fucking stupid and ignorant to smoke.
18:30 <@vorsprung> i think the point is that if you are a smoker you will die younger of a stroke/heart attack/cancer
18:30 <@music2> ewww
18:31 <@Greg> also the % of cancer deaths from smoking is higher than the others
18:31 <@Greg> and i think cancer is a nastier way to go
18:31 <@music2> that's what i was trying to find.  Are you actually less likely to get cancer if you stop smoking? Or will you have time to develop other cancers since you didn't have a heart attack at 60?
18:31 <@coraline> is this true for all strains of tobacco?
18:32 <@coraline> music2: the falloff curve for your death likelihood is the right side of a 1/x
18:32 <@Greg> music2: yes, IANAD, but i believe cancer is a less likely death if you don't smoke
18:32 <@coraline> first year, it drops something like fifty percent or something
18:32 <@coraline> (first year after smoking)
18:32 <@music2> Death likelihood still =1, isn't it?
18:32 <@Greg> as the primary disease that smoke increases the chance of is cancer
18:33 <@Greg> music2: yes, but at what age is death likelihood =1?
18:33 <@Greg> 60?
18:33 <@Greg> 80?
18:33 <+dipsy> 80 is, like, indeed the One True Terminal Width, i must agree
18:33 <@Greg> 100?
18:33 <+dipsy> i think 100 is Continue
18:33 <@Greg> 105?
18:33 <+dipsy> rumour has it 105 is somewhat limited, but if it does what you need, then 99 squid is a good price
18:33 <@music2> Lifetime risk. as richardc pointed out
18:33 <@Greg> 110?
18:33 <+dipsy> somebody said 110 was just coming to the end of an inquiry, which seems to have centered on whether it looks nice or not from Somerset House (and not anywhere else)
18:33 <@Greg> 115?
18:33 <@davorg> 200!
18:33 <@coraline> i think it's 15-20 years to return to normal death likelihood

18:39 <@Greg> cool
18:39 <@davorg> not really
18:39 <@Magnus> as it is you are not much older than a Magnus 
18:39 <@Greg> what age would you put me at if you didnt know davorg?
18:39 <@Greg> 21?
18:40 <+dipsy> somebody said 21 was pretty much average. 25 is about the most you get.
18:40 <@Greg> my wife got asked for ID recently she was pleased
18:40 <@Magnus> really?
18:40 <+dipsy> really is going offline now
18:40 <@Greg> this means that she has got so old that she is pleased when she is asked for ID
18:40 <@Magnus> how old does she look
18:40  * Greg shrugs
18:40 <@Magnus> I don' tthink I've ever seen a piccie
18:40 <@Greg> to me she looks like ron
18:40 <@Greg> not any age or any type
18:40 <@Greg> just ron
18:40 <@davorg> my wife was asked for id when she was about 30. she was furious.
18:40 <@Magnus> hahaha this girl I know
18:40 <@Magnus> 21
18:40 <@Magnus> drove into a petrol station
18:40 <@gellyfish> Oooh some fule wants to put XML::XSLT on the CD of a new book
18:40 <@Magnus> filled up her car
18:41 <@Magnus> and then they wouldn't accept payment
18:41 <@Greg> so davorg, how old do i seem?
18:41 <@Magnus> because they thought she was under 16
18:41 <@Magnus> so she said fine and drove off
18:41 <@Magnus> she was in the paper and everything
18:41 <@davorg> Greg: don't ask me. i'm crap at stuff like that.

18:44 <@hex> "puncuation" :)
18:44 <@Magnus> I'm sorry that that's the funniest thing I could possibly have said at that point.
18:44 <@Magnus> Greg: is she slightly goth
18:44 <@Greg> thats my wife, on the right
18:44 <@Magnus> or did the light just catch her wrongly
18:44 <@Greg> not really she liked heavy metal/rock clubs when she was young

19:15 <@slavorg> Ok
19:15 <@slavorg> Ok
19:16 <@jerakeen> it's a little laggy on startup, even with poe it can only do one thing at once, and slavorg is in a lot of channels nowaqdays.
19:17 <@richardc> is it's one thing saving the world from lazer-equipped sharks?
19:17 <@Trelane> make it threaded
19:17 <@Trelane> or, make sky make it threaded
19:17 <@davorg> right. i'm off to play in the hmv sale
19:18 <@davorg> i'll be in the pub about 6:30
19:18 -!- davorg is now known as dav_pub
19:18 <@richardc> that won't help so much, unless each thread manages a seperate irc connection
19:18 <@Trelane> sounds like a plan
19:19 <@richardc> at which point you might as well just fork the bugger
19:21 <@gellyfish> fork it, fork 'em all
19:21 <@gellyfish> fork everything
19:21 <@bob> fork you and fork you to
19:21 <@hex> You forkin' talkin' to me?
19:22 <@hex> You talk the talk, but do you fork() the fork()?
19:22 <@jerakeen> nah, slav works very well, it's just startup that makes it sluggish.
19:22 <@jerakeen> and it doesn't start very often.
19:22 <@blech_> jerakeen: should clunker be a little less widespread?
19:23 <@jerakeen> clunker's main function is to recover from slavorg bouncing, and as such it should be everywhere slavorg is. it's not like it makes much noise.
19:23 <@blech_> Most channels should be able to rely on someone being around to keep ops during short slavorg downtimes.
19:23 <@jerakeen> do peole mind clunker? I hear no complaints.
19:23 <@blech_> It's messy, and it confuses people. I've seen people who didn't know what clunker was.

15:42 <@muttley> The one thing I like about the bastardised templating language we have at work is that endif statements can repeat the conditional clause
15:43 <@muttley> so
15:43 <@muttley> <!-- $some_variable=="foo" -->
15:43 <@muttley> <!-- endif \$some_variable=="foo" -->
15:43 <@muttley> (without the backslash)
15:44 <@muttley> which is nice because the language can't be indented so it's good for nested ifs
15:44 <@muttley> however I'm wondering if it would be possible to port this to perl
15:44 <@muttley> and have it check that the conditional match up
15:44 <@muttley> if ($some_variable eq 'foo') {
15:44 -!- mstevens [~mstevens@kochi.etla.org] has quit [gone]
15:45 <@muttley> } endif($some_variable eq 'foo')
15:45 <@muttley> with the endif being optional
15:45 <@RanAway> muttley: wouldn't that mean U're in a loop, so could use 'last if $some_variable eq 'foo'' ?
15:45 -!- RanAway is now known as Ranguard
15:48  * DrHyde mutters about spammers
16:04 <@muttley> Ranguard: kind of missing the point
16:04 <@muttley> the only function of the endif block would be to check to see if the conditional was the same as the one at the top
16:04 <@muttley> if they mismatched then you'd get an error
16:09 <@DrHyde> what's the point?  to catch typos?

17:55 <@droogs> good oh
17:55  * Ranguard had a talk about copyright and patents - was really interesting
17:55  * droogs is rather chuffed he has made a start on very basic directed tree graph plotting
17:55 <@droogs> nowhere near enough for graphviz but rather cool none the less

18:03 <@Greg> congrats
18:03 <@TJ_home> cheers
18:03 <@Greg> good luck and all for the last few days of waiting
18:03 <@TJ_home> not sure how I will pay for it mind
18:04 <@TJ_home> but will cross that bridge when we come to it
18:04 <@DrHyde> credit cards!
18:04 <+dipsy> credit cards are a mug's game
18:04 <@TJ_home> ah yes
18:04 <@TJ_home> I was thinking of growing dope in the back garden
18:04 <@Greg> TJ_home: my theory has always been for mortgages (which i dont have at the minute), is no matter the type of mortgage have it paid out of a savings/seperate account
18:04 <@Greg> and always aim to fill that account as much as you can
18:04 <@TJ_home> yes
18:04 <@Greg> i.e. for the first 6 months in the new property try and get n extra months rent spare in it
18:05 <@TJ_home> yeah, the deposit from the flat is 2 months payments
18:05  * Ranguard make sure payments are on the 1st of the month and he's payed on the last of the month
18:05 <@Greg> it'll be shit for the start
18:05 <@TJ_home> so should have some breathing space
18:05  * Greg intends to buy later this year
18:05 <@TJ_home> if we have to sell in 2 months time then we would make a net profit
18:05 <@Greg> and then get a pay rise ;-)
18:06 <@TJ_home> several repayments end soon which will make life easier
18:06 <@TJ_home> the student loans are a bit of an albatross tho
18:06 <@Ranguard> TJ_home: U're remembering stamp duty yea ?
18:06 <@Greg> Ranguard++ # leet estate agent knowledge ;-)
18:06 <@TJ_home> Ranguard: yup - have the inheritance from my mum which I have been keeping in an ISA
18:06 <@Ranguard> Greg: how's that going :)
18:07 <@TJ_home> not silly
18:07 <@Greg> what going?
18:07 <@TJ_home> house hunting
18:07 <@Ranguard> just wasn't sure how if you sold in 2 months U'd make a profit
18:07 <@TJ_home> Ranguard: buyer pays stamp duty
18:07 <@Ranguard> yea - U moving
18:07 <@Greg> soon
18:07 <@Greg> well not really
18:07 <@Ranguard> heh :)
18:07 <@Greg> 3 months is our aim to start taking it seriously
18:07 <@Greg> in the next 3 we are preparing
18:08 <@Greg> so thats looking around
18:08 <@TJ_home> thats 3 mortgage payments you could be making
18:08 <@TJ_home> ;)
18:08 <@Greg> and also clearing out this house of junks
18:08 <@Ranguard> TJ_home: yea, but I mean U'll have lost that money on the place you are buying - so how come U'll make a proffit - or has the value gone up lots ?
18:08 <@Greg> TJ_home: its ok our rent is fairly cheap and i am sort of makign the payments as our house treasure chest is growing at a nice fast rate
18:08 <@TJ_home> nice
18:09 <@TJ_home> Ranguard: we pushed down the price
18:09 <@TJ_home> the way they presented and sold it was really bad
18:09 <@Ranguard> Greg: kerrie scoured the net for about 2 months before we moved, getting to know areas and what sort of stuff we could afford
18:09 <@TJ_home> also new carpets and curtains
18:09 <@Ranguard> TJ_home: ahh :)
18:09 <@TJ_home> a good clean and decent presentation would put the value up by about 5 to 10 l
18:09 <@TJ_home> s/l/k/
18:10 <@TJ_home> also we put our first offer down in january so we have 6 month of a rising (if slowly) market
18:10  * Ranguard nods
18:10 <@TJ_home> but a rising market means that where you buy after selling will also have gone up so you discount that
18:11 <@TJ_home> the house is small and needs refurbishing but is a very good investment
18:11 <@Ranguard> especially if U're moving to somewhere larger (eg more expensive)
18:11 <@TJ_home> Ranguard: yeah - then you have to bargain harder and find somewhere with more 'potential'
18:11  * DrHyde larfs at the idea of a house being an investment
18:12 <@DrHyde> they're horrible horrible money-sinks
18:12 <@TJ_home> DrHyde: no thats cars and computers
18:12 <@TJ_home> houses hold value in the long term
18:12 <@DrHyde> and when you sell at a profit, you'll only need to spend all that profit to get somewhere vaguely decent to replace it
18:13 <@Ranguard> DrHyde: I made 50% on made on my last flat - over 4 years - don't call that a money-sink
18:13 <@TJ_home> DrHyde: thats why you buy somewhere shitty and then sell it to gullible / lazy first time buyers for an inflated price
18:13 <@Ranguard> DrHyde: though U do end up spending lots on all the stuff you want to do to a place - or at least you can
18:13 <@TJ_home> the right work on a house can increase its value by far more than its cost
18:14 <@TJ_home> i.e. GCH, dbl glzing, garden, conservatory, etc
18:14 <@TJ_home> decent bathroom and kitchen, etc
18:14 <@Ranguard> TJ_home: this place I'm at now we're planning on staying in for at least 5 to 10 years - so money spent is because we want / need something doing
18:15  * mstevens has been keeping an eye on the prices of houses in east london for a year or so, they continue to be far too expensive for me
18:15 <@TJ_home> Ranguard: the stuff we're doing will put up the value quickly but at the same time *we* really want them
18:15 <@sphyg> lo
18:15  * Ranguard has an idead for putting a doule height conservatory on the back of the house but has since found out it's likley to be 30 to 40k! so might not do it after all :)
18:15 <@Greg> DrHyde: property is a good retirement option im opinion
18:16 <@Greg> which is special subclass of investment
18:16 <@Ranguard> mstevens: that's where my last flat was - but bought 5 years ago
18:16 <@mstevens> hi sphyg
18:16 <@Greg> i reckon when we buy this year we can finish the mortgage in about 5~10 years depending if stock options come off or not
18:16 <@mstevens> ranguard: I was a poor stoodent 5 years ago
18:17  * Ranguard faints on greg
18:17  * mstevens is still trying to pay off the debt of being a stoodent
18:17 <@Greg> we just dont spend much when we are being sensible
18:17 <@DrHyde> Ranguard: this place has apparently increased in valud by something like 65% since i bought it *but* I will have to spend all of that to get somewhere else if i decide to sell it
18:17 <@Greg> so we have a lot spare to put into those top up account sort of things
18:18 <@Ranguard> DrHyde: sure, if you want to stay in the same area
18:18 <@DrHyde> no, even if i want to move

18:27 <@TJ_home> Quidity: at the moment I am working on relative positions

17:51 <@davorg_> is that wrong?
17:52 <@richardc> well where is not being the author and getting the credit right?
17:53 <@baud> he recommended it to me.
17:53 <@Ranguard> ahh :)
17:53 <@richardc> be more clear damnit
17:53 <@davorg_> don't think i claimed any credit
17:53 <@richardc> Ranguard++ # Data::Pageset author
17:54 <@Ranguard> davorg_: didn't see you mention it at all, just saw bauds davorg++ :)
17:54 <@baud> ok, here's a weird error...
17:54 <@davorg_> oh. ok.
17:54 <@richardc> davorg_: I didn't say you'd claimed any credit
17:54 <@baud> Sort subroutine didn't return a numeric value
17:54 <@Ranguard> shit, shouldn't have owned up to it :)
17:54 <@baud> The code is: sort { $b->[2] <=> $a->[2] } @probs;
17:55 <@Ranguard> oh, not a wierd error in Data::pageset - that's ok :)
17:55 <@richardc> that's weird, since the spaceship really should be returning a number
17:55 <@Ranguard> baud: what did it return ?
17:56 <@richardc> unless the values have some kind of overloading I suppose
17:56 <@baud> Ranguard: I dunno - I just got an email (which our system sends me on exceptions)
17:56 <@baud> and the error doesn't say what it returned.
17:56 <@baud> richardc: I can't get the spaceship to return non-numeric in all my testing.
17:56 <@baud> I think it's cosmic rays.
17:57 <@baud> this code has processed over a billion emails, so something random is bound to go wrong eventually.
17:58 <@davorg_> it's probably some evil spammer trick :)
17:58 <@baud> well good. Since that's a 1 in 1 billion that he's sneaked through our system :)
17:58 <@Ranguard> baud: how many error emails have you had ? - my rule of thumb is if I can be bothered to delete the emails, it's not a problem, when I get too bored of them I go fix the problem :)
17:58 <@Nicholas> spaceship will return undef on NaN comparisons, IIRC
17:59 <@baud> Ranguard: just 1 :)
17:59 <@baud> Nicholas: ooh, didn't try that.
17:59 <@Greg> but what if you want to choose between peshwari and keema ?
17:59 <@Nicholas> I remember correctly:
17:59 <@Nicholas> $ perl -wle 'print 1 <=> "NaN"'
17:59 <@Nicholas> Argument "NaN" isn't numeric in ncmp at -e line 1.
17:59 <@Nicholas> Use of uninitialized value at -e line 1.
18:00 <@Nicholas> baud: I'm cheating. I've looked at the source to pp_ncmp (at some point)
18:00 <@baud> hmm
18:00 <@baud> $ perl -le 'print sort { 1 <=> "NaN" } qw(foo)'
18:00 <@baud> prints: foo
18:00 <@davorg_> Greg: that's not hard. the answer is always peshwari
18:01 <@richardc> baud: -wle ?
18:01 <@baud> $ perl -wle 'print sort { 1 <=> "NaN" } qw(foo)'
18:01 <@baud> prints foo too
18:01 <@Nicholas> on linux. IIRC FreBSD doesn't do NaNs
18:01 <@richardc> since it's a warning, according to perldiag
18:01  * CPAN upload: Class-WeakSingleton-1.02 by JJORE
18:02 <@baud> on perl 5.6.1 I get:
18:02 <@baud> Argument "NaN" isn't numeric in numeric comparison (<=>) at -e line 1.
18:02 <@baud> foo
18:02  * baud tries 5.005
18:02 <@Greg> davorg_: depends the quality of the keema, all to often keema nan are crap, but when you get a place that does a really good one with a nice ghee rich curry its lovely
18:02 <@davorg_> Weak Singleton? "There can be only One! (if that's alright with the rest of you)"
18:02 <@Greg> and just enough chilli to blow the taste sensation
18:02 <@baud> 5.005 - same as 5.6.1
18:03 <@Nicholas> I got the undef on 5.005_03 on x86 Linux
18:04 <@baud> I didn't think 5.00503 supported "NaN"
18:05 <@richardc> Nicholas: odd, on my linux 5.5.3 I get the "isn't numeric" one
18:05 <@Nicholas> IIRC no version has actually created NaNs, but some libc's atof()s can parse NaN and Inf correctly
18:06 <@Nicholas> ie not created NaNs itself (in the tokeniser), but if a string->number conversion happens, you get whatever atof() outputs. [prior to 5.8.0]
18:06 <@richardc> on maint@19567 I get no warnings
18:07 <@Nicholas> 5.8.0 has internal atof() replacement code that definately can't do NaNs
18:08 <@baud> I thought NaN was in the plans for 5.8. Odd.
18:08 <@Nicholas> it probably was, but IIRC it never got in
18:09 <@Nicholas> there's a bug open (IIRC) that 5.8 doesn't have NaNs while 5.6.1 did
18:09 <@Nicholas> meanwhile, my question:
18:09 <@richardc> quick, just force it into 5.8.1 :)
18:09 <@Nicholas> On SuSE, does anyone know how to stop it starting portmapper at boot?
18:09 <@baud> of course none of these are causing the error I saw!
18:09 <@Nicholas> what was your error again?
18:10 <@baud> Sort subroutine didn't return a numeric value
18:10 <@richardc> remove the package it's in?
18:14 <@TeeJay> nice - our servers run H::T 2.5 rather than the 2.6 that the dev server has
18:14 <@TeeJay> leading to problems with template variable scoping and inexplicable disappearing data
18:14 <@Nicholas> that will probaly work, butg really I'd like to just deconfigure it
18:15 <@Ranguard> Nicholas: does it not just get started from /etc/rc*.d ?
18:15 <@Nicholas> yes.
18:15 <@Nicholas> and the correct answer is "runlevel editor" which is off System in YaST
18:15 <@richardc> Nicholas: dunno then.  the alternate thing I abuse on debian is putting exit 0 at the top of /etc/init.d/$foo
18:16 <@richardc> for when I can't remove $foo due to dependencies, but it doesn't actually need to run
18:17 <@Nicholas> I'd like to leave it installed so that I can start it manually if needed

20:06 <@robin_sz> hmmm ... it can be a problem
20:06 <@robin_sz> personallyt I find I work best in the evenings, esp from home

20:07 <@robin_sz> ah yes, TV. how novel
20:08 <@richardc> well it's that or read something, and since most of today has resembled reading things, I think I'll go with the no effort required variety of entertainment
20:10 <@robin_sz> you could try finding somehting small and furry and crushing it to death ....
20:10 <@richardc> :)
20:11  * richardc &
20:12 <@robin_sz> see, I knew that would cheer him up.
20:12 <@Greg> re: working at home, i find its best to get up and do the lions share of your work between 6.00 and 10.00 and then irk your coworkers
20:12 <@Greg> its an old philosophy but it seems to work ... for me
20:13 <@robin_sz> depends you are a lark or owl 
20:13 <@robin_sz> its a genetic thing, no point fighting it
20:13 <@Greg> its most likely a booze thing
20:14 <@Greg> i.e. i'd guess owls probably dont get much done after a boozy pub lunch
20:14 <@robin_sz> anyone who wants me to go to work before 9am usually gets me to turn up (probably late) but they are wasting their money
20:15 <@robin_sz> not all of us do boozy pub lunches btw
20:16 <@Greg> bah
20:16 <@Greg> its the best way ;-)
20:16  * Greg notes every dot com he ever worked for made a profit
20:16 <@Greg> and no company he has ever worked for went out of business
20:16 <@robin_sz> actually I dont even do lunch at all most days.

20:17 <@Greg> yarr
20:19 <@robin_sz> hmm
20:19 <@robin_sz> I need a tame CVS guru to lead this opensource project mess back onto the path of working again
20:20 <@robin_sz> sigh ... why do all open source projects go off the rails?
20:20 <@Greg> rule 1
20:20 <@robin_sz> sigh, I fear you might be right.
20:21 <@robin_sz> at the moment no one can get the core library to compile ... it has a million and one #ifdef's aimed to make it work on half a dozen esoteric platforms no one uses

20:22 <@Greg> what project is this?
20:22 <@robin_sz> we are just discussing chucking all that shit out and one of the guys starts wondering if it can be made to run on an xbox ...
20:22 <@robin_sz> Greg: emc, a linux based CNC motion controller
20:23 <@robin_sz> the CVS has NO tags in it at all apart frome 'start' :(
20:23  * CPAN upload: GD-Graph-radar-0.02 by GENE
20:23 <@Greg> do you have any release tarballs that you could cunningly compare and use to make tags?
20:24 <@robin_sz> not yet, but I have a CD in the post that apparetnyl does
20:24 <@robin_sz> last time anyone got it to build from CVS was january 
20:25 < vorsprun1> robin_sz, i usually like doing that kind of stuff
20:26 < vorsprun1> robin_sz, but it gets depressing when you fix it for the 10,000th time and the very next week it is totally shafted again
20:26 <@robin_sz> vorsprun1: sure. I don't mind people committing stuff that breaks the head of the CVS, so long as there is a working tag somewhere befor they broke it
20:27 <@robin_sz> and .. three isn't :(
20:27 < vorsprun1> robin_sz, yeppers
20:27 <@robin_sz> looks like time for the bastard project manager from hell 
20:28 <@robin_sz> "dear X, your last submission failed to compile. I deleted it."
20:29 <@robin_sz> its not helped by running under linux with the real-time extensions ... of which there are two flavours, with different API's .. and trying to make it run on sparc, ppc, solaris, arm, i386 .. etc

23:22 <@BradB> yoda: Nothing
23:23 <@BradB> I would have done something about it, if there were an error to fix :)
23:23 <@acme> you are learning the joy of apache
23:23 <@yoda> hmm. i'm usually lucky and find an error to decipher when i'm having problems myself
23:24 <@BradB> Unfortunately no error is happening in this case :/
23:24 <@BradB> Apache just isn't DWIM
23:25 <@DrHyde> do you have any location redirection weirdness happening?
23:25 <@yoda> apache can read the htpasswd file i assume. no problems with the file permissions?
23:25 <@BradB> Note: When I mv .htpasswd .htpasswd~ no error is reported, which...well...is fucking crappy.
23:26 <@BradB> DrHyde: Nope.
23:27 <@DrHyde> apache is looking at the right .htpasswd?
23:29 <@BradB> Shitfuck. I know why now.
23:29 <@BradB> It's because Location / has MySQL authentication setup
23:29 <@BradB> And I'm overriding that in /bradb, but it's still wanting to do MySQL-based auth
23:32 <@Nicholas> seen cpan
23:32 <+dipsy> cpan was last seen on #london.pm 1 hours, 14 minutes and 30 seconds ago, saying: upload: Tk-CollapsableFrame-1.2 by LUSOL [Fri Jul 18 20:15:05 2003]

23:34 <@BradB> Fuck I hate Apache.
23:35 <@Nicholas> use IIS instead? :-)
23:35 <@BradB> Ew.
23:35 <@BradB> There's just so many occassions where Apache doesn't behave in ways that I expect it would.
23:35 <@Nicholas> thttpd? zeus?
23:36 <@yoda> does putting the /bradb location bit before the / location bit make it work? is it order sensitive over that? (i know some bits of the config are)
23:36 <@BradB> Hmmm...I wouldn't think it would. But it doesn't matter now. It Just Works.

23:39 <@yoda> [[ <Location> sections are processed in the order thety appear in the configuration file, after the <directory> sections and .htaccess files are read, and after the <files> sections ]]
23:39 <@yoda> so i was recalling correctly :)
23:40 <@BradB> Interesting
23:40 <@BradB> But, that'd be an odd way to lay things out
23:40 <@BradB> I'd expect to see the most top-level declarations nearer the top of a configuration file
23:40 <@yoda> you have to do the same with alias stuff
23:40 <@yoda> well, it's there in the core docs anyway :)
23:41 <@BradB> Yeah, they're not very good unless you know Apache really well though.
23:41 <@BradB> e.g. Reading how to setup .htaccess doesn't really tell you how to setup .htaccess.
23:41 <@yoda> just searched for the location directive and there it was
23:42 <@BradB> yoda: Yeah, but why would I have thought to search on that?
23:42 <@BradB> This is why the mysql auth guys made Auth_MySQL off
23:42 <@yoda> because you were using location directives?
23:42 <@BradB> Yeah, I'm using Directory directives, ScriptAliases and .htaccess files too
23:42 <@BradB> and .htpasswd's
23:43 <@yoda> ah, ok ;)

18:23 <@AlexMc> london.pm was bidding to make paris.pm's website english
18:23 <@AlexMc> and vice versa - make london.pm homepage french
18:23 <@AlexMc> (just home page - not the whole site)
18:23 <@Quidity> Ah.
18:23 <@kane> so paul makepiece put up 700 EUR for esperanto -- guess who won
18:25 <@ali> thought it was just the front page that was going to be switched?
18:27 <@jerakeen> yes
18:28 <@mstevens> gah, this \o/ thing is spreading, it was bad enough when it was just dl-bar doing it...
18:29 <@ali> drowning man?
18:30  * ali wonders what happened to just using english (or your language of choice) to express yourself?
18:30 <@mstevens> I'm not really sure, to be honest, it usually seems to be a vaguely positive expression so I was assuming something with the waving the arms around cheering
18:31  * ali draws you a ****ing picture.
18:33  * mstevens gets shaky, and decides food is a stunningly good idea

18:37 <@jerakeen> course, I've since fixed the screen on the original. Yay, 2 laptops!
18:37 <@acme> i assume that cracked lcds are expensive to replace
18:38 <@jerakeen> This was an old thinkpad one, I got a replacement off ebay for ~£100
18:38 <@jerakeen> I suppose you'll have to go through apple or something. warranty/applecare?
18:38 <@jerakeen> this is the reason I keep meaning to get some sort of insurance.
18:42 <@jerakeen> can anyone recommend insurance for laptops?

21:37 <@TeeJay> even stemming can do more harm than good in a search

21:41 <@AlexMc_> TeeJay: I'm just a class::DBI beginner, only been using it for a short while
21:41 <@TeeJay> fair enough
21:42  * TeeJay hasn't used it that much
21:42 <@AlexMc_> Teejay
21:42 <@TeeJay> yes?
21:42 <@AlexMc_> I may want to chat about searching with Class::DBI though
21:42 <@TeeJay> cool
21:42 <@AlexMc_> (sorry hit return too early)
21:42 <@TeeJay> ah
21:43 <@AlexMc_> I implemented this book database and one of the problems is searching for authors, titles, etc
21:43 <@richardc> Class::DBI::AbstractSearch, it's about all you need to know
21:43 <@TeeJay> richardc, ooh?
21:43 <@AlexMc_> richardc: well that's what I am using
21:43 <@PerfDave> I haven't yet used Class::DBI, I intend to look at it for the next YADatabaseBackedWebsite I do
21:44  * richardc wanders off
21:44 <@TeeJay> AlexMc, so whats wrong with it
21:44 <@AlexMc_> PerfDave: it is piss easy, and far better than writing your own SQL
21:44 <@AlexMc_> TeeJay: wanted some tips for doing fancy searches like titles that people have half forgotten 
21:45 <@AlexMc_> or aliases/pseudonyms
21:45 <@PerfDave> Hmm. How good is it at optimising though? When I hand-write SQL I can normlly get stupid performance gains just by minor tweaks to the SQL statement.
21:45 <@AlexMc_> PerfDave: fuck knows :-)
21:45 <@TeeJay> ah dads here

21:46 <@TeeJay> will see how I can work it in
21:46 <@mugwump> Usually getting the structure of the tables is more the key to efficient queries
21:46 <@AlexMc_> TeeJay - don't change your article unless it is appropriate
21:47 <@TeeJay> doing a lookup on a nice reverse index is really fucking fast
21:47 <@TeeJay> simple query too
21:47 <@TeeJay> AlexMc - uh, only done the intro :(
21:47 <@TeeJay> anyway mail me at givemecoolsearchpower@droogs.org
21:47 <@mugwump> on the other hand, each index to a table adds an overhead to updates
21:48 <@TeeJay> mugwump, reverse index means only one table and one index to update
21:49 <@TeeJay> also most updates can be made low priority
21:49 <@AlexMc_> oh bugger - I am beginning to like JSPWIki
21:49 <@TeeJay> anyways - tiles to do
21:49 <@AlexMc_> Any suggestions for grout which has mould on it
21:49 <@AlexMc_> (just the bath sealant - I suppose it needs replacing)
21:49 <@mugwump> bleach ?
21:49 <+dipsy> hmmm... bleach is cool. Mix it with acidic cleaners and you get chlorine.

19:44 <@richardc> all train lines are special
19:44 <@marcel> that's a rather theoretical maximum, isn't it? it's not its sustainable cruise speed
19:44 <@Greg> withough going to silly levels
19:44 <@blech_> Greg: even if there are, and they're generally available, they can't do that legally.
19:44 <@richardc> Greg: do they contain 20 screaming kids and one disctracted programmer?
19:44 <@blech_> marcel: sustained cruise is 300km/h or 186 mph
19:45 <@Greg> blech_: im sure they can somewhere
19:45 <@blech_> Odd I feel the need to write the SI units properly.
19:45 <@Greg> and im not talking really stupid cars like the mclaren
19:45 <@Greg> not that i care
19:46 <@Greg> but speed is not a reason to favour cars over trains
19:46 <@Greg> getting up and walking around is
19:46 <@blech_> Truth.
19:46 <@marcel> you can get up and walk around in a train
19:46 <@Greg> yarr
19:46 <@Greg> this is why trains are good
19:46 <@Greg> cars have other advantages
19:46 <@Magnus> you can drive right to your door in a car
19:46 <@Greg> e.g. my home is not waterloo station
19:47 <@Greg> ok lets all stop
19:47 <@blech_> breathing?
19:47 <+dipsy> breathing is probably better than eating
19:47 <@Greg> trains vs. cars pros and cons is an exercise for primary school kids

19:47 <@Magnus> my car leaves when I want it to
19:47 <@Magnus> and it always waits for me

20:42 <@hex> What is the cure for a bony elbow?
20:43 <@Elthek> Amputation.
20:43 <+dipsy> amputation is the answer
20:43  * Elthek nods towards dipsy.
20:44 <@aef> Aren't elbow's supposed to be bony?
20:45 <@aef> *elbows
20:45 <@Elthek> Only if the people owning them can't use apostr.. ohyoufixedthatalready.
20:45 <@hex> I believe so. However mine is reacting badly to my desk.
20:46  * hex made a temporary fix by placing a space mousepad under it, face-down.

20:56  * aef 's elbows aren't on his desk during typing.
20:57 <@hex> Yes, on the desk.
20:57 <@hex> How far away is your keyboard?
20:57  * hex is using a laptop, which starts about 8 inches away from him.
20:57 <@aef> A couple of inches from the edge of my desk.
20:57 <@aef> Ah. laptops--
20:58 <@aef> Move laptop closer?
20:58 <@hex> Surely you mean further?
20:58  * hex moves his chair back
20:58 <@aef> Um, no.
20:59 <@hex> Er, then I have to raise my shoulders awkwardly.
21:03 <@aef> If your laptop is so far away, that your arms are so far forward, your elbows are on the desk, I'd move it much closer.
21:03 <@hex> Ah, I didn't mention that I'm using an L-shaped desk.
21:03 <@aef> Ahh.
21:03 <@aef> IKWYM.
21:03  * hex is in the elbow, so to speak.
21:03 <@aef> Had that at BA.
21:03  * hex nods
21:03 <@hex> It's handy, but means that the desk extends under at least one arm.
21:03 <@aef> Don't work in the corner of the desk. Or, sit a bit higher up.
21:03 <@hex> Yeah... I recently switched to an old-fashioned non-rotating chair, which seems to be a lot better for my back.
21:03 <@hex> Maybe I should get a cushion.

21:14 <@Trelane> I have no idea
21:14 <@Trelane> hang on, I decided it might be a good idea to backup the repository before doing anyhting else
21:15 <@hex> Wimp.
21:15 <@tomboh> Indeed.  Then pkg_delete 'apr-*' should clean up any badness.
21:15 <@Trelane> ah yes, I have apr-0.9.3           The Apache Group's Portability Library
21:15 <@Trelane> hmm
21:15 <@Trelane> pkg_delete: package 'apr-0.9.3' is required by these other packages
21:15 <@Trelane> and may not be deinstalled:
21:15 <@Trelane> subversion-0.21.0
21:16 <@kane> pkg_delete subversion --now --die --kill
21:16 <@Trelane> eeek
21:16 <@tomboh> If you delete subversion first, then apr, then rebuild subversion WITH_MOD_DAV_SVN that should work
21:16 <@Trelane> arse, that means I have to break the box before upgrading it
21:17  * Trelane mehs
21:17 <@tomboh> Ports is evil like that... pkgsrc looks shinier, must play with it sometime

21:18  * Trelane tries compiling without MOD_SVN
21:20 <@tomboh> pkg_version -L '=' may suggest other relevant packages that are out of date, but really the port should notify you of that earlier on. hmmm...
21:21 <@Trelane> how is one suposed to know this vodo?

23:12 <@BradB> ah, the magic of right-clicking
23:12 <@blech_> Ah, so they are. Well, it's fine in Safari, so webcore/khtml shouldn't be the culprit.
23:13 <@BradB> oh well, i only use konqueror because CIBC's Javascript fucks up in Mozilla
23:13 <@Dom2> Hmmm, that's an impressive fuck up of the gnu site

12:33 <@blech_> I think there was a story on the front of some freebie local rag about someone who worked at Mosquito Bikes being run over. All very sad.

12:34 <@hex> Good luck.

12:35 <@blech_> Drinks at London.pm after a company goes bust. Hmm.
12:36 <@davorg> well we're not going bust (not this week) we're just being sold off
12:38 <@Nicholas> pimped to the highest bidder
12:38 <@gellyfish> we got sold and the effect was similar to being bust
12:38  * davorg hears there were only 2 bidders
12:38 <@Dom2> davorg: webbl and bob?
12:38 <@Dom2> Pie!  More Pie!
12:38 <@Greg> how much pie will III make us?
12:39 <@Nicholas> 3.147 ?
12:39 <@davorg> we've not been told who the biders were
12:40 <@gellyfish> Rarr!
12:44 <@AlexMc> davorg: but you aren't a permie for them so you don't care that much do you?
12:45 <@Kake> Don't even assume that permies will care :)
12:45 <@blech_> Same shit, different boss?
12:47 <@davorg> AlexMc: no, but it would be nice to know if i'm wasting my time doing this work
12:47 <@Greg> you are
12:47 <@davorg> it's possible that the buyers might only want a) the hardware or b) the database
12:47 <@DrHyde> are you getting paid?  this determines whether you're wasting your time.

13:08 <@Kake> IRC is useful, see how I learned about tramp earlier.
13:08 <@AlexMc> tramp?
13:08 <+dipsy> i think tramp is an emacs tool that allows remote access to files via ssh/scp/rcp/telnet/etc or apt-gettable, yay
13:08 <@Kake> They haven't *refused* to pay for it.  I think they may just have not been properly asked.
13:09 <@AlexMc> I had a contract like that from "BT" (ie O2 really) which said that I would be physically expelled from the building if I started work without a purchase order
13:09 <@AlexMc> but of course their own paperwork was so slow and they wanted me to start "tomorrow".

13:33 <@davorg> not necessarily
13:33 <@Greg> when you assume ...
13:34 <@AlexMc> well, yes, I *assume*, I don't know
13:34 <@Greg> it implies it uses CGI which when i last looked even VB supported through a crufty STDIN/STDOUT hack
13:34 <@AlexMc> yeah - I guess so
13:35 <@AlexMc> anything with STDIN/STDOUT could be cgi
13:35 <@davorg> but the chances of it being a perl program are pretty good

13:40 <@davorg> they have shops for those you know

13:40 <@davorg> :)
13:41 <@davorg> i bet they do if you know where to look
13:42 <@davorg> or is basingstoke a smoke free zone?
13:42 <@Greg> wait a second, there is a cigar place on high holborn
13:42 <@Greg> DrHyde: if uncle greggy can get away would you like a cigar?
13:43 <@DrHyde> yes please uncle greggy
13:43 <@DrHyde> i like my uncle greggy
13:43 <@richardc> I sspect you may be confusing the easy availbility of the common cigarette with the pleasnt experiance of having someone toady up to you in a proper shop
13:43 <@Greg> then you shall go to the ball
13:43 <@Greg> richardc?
13:43 <+dipsy> i guess richardc is  a scary man with spikier metal in his ear or not a whinger, really or a girlie-man (see cider) or the perfect personal shopper for all your smiting needs or relentless or a vampire suspect or occasionally cynical or 'the veritable embodyment of help itself' or lovely or don't let him shave the beard off again or Key Lime Pie.  but that's probably because I can't answer the first question

13:45 <@Magnus> does anyone know if SCO have a serious case?
13:45 <@DrHyde> yes, they have a serious case of delusions
13:45 <@davorg> yes. they don't.
13:45 <@richardc> they're serious, but lack a case
13:45 <@Magnus> so it's just FUD?
13:45 <@pjcj> $699 for a licence - while stocks last.
13:46 <@Greg> put it this way, we have 15,000 linux servers of our own distro, and haven't even bothered to rate SCO as a risk
13:46 <@Greg> in our QER
13:47 <@pjcj> qer?
13:47 <@AlexMc> doesn't this SCO case involve a small part of some multi-cpu code which few people use anyway?
13:47 <@pjcj> come on dipsy
13:47 <@Greg> quarterly earnings report
13:47 <@Magnus> I wonder why they haven't gone after akamai
13:48 <@Greg> Magnus: because akamai are far too cool a company to be afraid of them
13:48 <@Magnus> AlexMc: if it's in there, makes no difference if it's used or not, surely?
13:48 <@pjcj> But they are still selling single cpu licences..
13:49 <@AlexMc> Magnus: but end users can't be done for "copying" pirated software - only using it - and so if it is limited to some useless code they can say "no - we wont pay, but we will remove the code"
13:50 <@AlexMc> ok - so that lat solution is not easy but it could be done
13:50 <@AlexMc> frankly someone should stomp SCO
13:50 <@pjcj> You can only remove it if SCO tell you what the code is.
13:51 <@AlexMc> if they haven't then SCO can go screw themselves
13:51 <@Magnus> oooh I get to meet Philippa Forrester tonight
13:51 <@adam> AlexMc: quite - the problem is, as soon as they tell someone will rewrite it and their entire case goes away
13:51 <@adam> which is why they're not telling
13:51 <@AlexMc> adam: exactly my point
13:51 <@AlexMc> I agree
13:51 <@pdcawley> Oh ghod. Magnus. Phlippa Forrester. Fast Seduction. Help!
13:51 <@AlexMc> what pdcawly said.
13:51 <@richardc> wait, you had a point?
13:52 <@AlexMc> ooh richardc trolling again
13:52 <@richardc> I thought your point was "screw 'em"
13:52 <@adam> AlexMc: which is going to happen if any of the farcical crap ever makes it to court
13:52 <@richardc> no, I'm just confused
13:52 <@adam> richardc: we know, don't worry your little head over it ;)
13:52 <@AlexMc> richardc: I made the point that they had no case
13:52 <@AlexMc> hence the response "screw em"
13:52 <@richardc> everyone knows they have no case. there is no point to be making
13:53 <@PerfDave> I think our policy on SCO is "Wait for the court judgement, and if it goes tits up there's always FreeBSD"
13:53 <@AlexMc> excuse me for stating the obvious
13:53 <@Ranguard> Is it really just a small section of multiprocessor code, I thought they were claiming it was more fundimental than that ?
13:53 <@richardc> ok
13:53 <+dipsy> AlexMc: The server at bofh.engr.wisc.edu (port 666) appears to be down.

15:22 <@davorg> excellent
15:22 <@davorg> so when do we get to see the site?
15:22  * DrHyde wonders who rozallin is
15:23 <+pasty> "hex" at 217.10.129.148 pasted Sorry, what am I looking for in this dmesg output? at http://paste.husk.org/53
15:23 <@rozallin> Well, a portfolio is no good unless you have something to actually put in it, so I'll be working on it among other things in the next six weeks. You'll just have to keep bugging me :)
15:23 <@davorg> :)
15:23 <@davorg> count on it
15:25 <@davorg> DrHyde: rozallin is a Perlmonk and an LJer and will be moving to London soon

15:27 <@rozallin> Hi @)
15:27  * Trelane remembers to read LJ
15:27 <@rozallin> :) even
15:27 <@rozallin> Although that's a very good representation of what the sun is doing to my eyes. 
15:28 <@marna> That looks like you're screwing up your eyes while grinning....
15:28 <@hex> Trelane: after the competition winner is announced, will there be a page on the site with all the entries?
15:28 <@marna> It should be adopted for hot-weather smiley-face-ies
15:28 <@davorg> hex: in esperanto :)
15:28 <@hex> Ay caramba!
15:30 <@Trelane> hex: er...yes!
15:30  * hex has fun reading the MediaSurface page on londongeek
15:30 <@rozallin> I woke up under my skylight this morning bathed in sunlight, and hurt my eyes.
15:30 <@Trelane> daystar still bad
15:30  * DrHyde wonders what "automatic bolus reduction" is
15:30 <@davorg> Trelane: i have with me spare copies of "practical mod_perl" and "games, diversions and perl culture". You can have them as prizes or I can just give them to random people who are nice to me.
15:30 <@Greg> ah, so is there still time to make entries?
15:30 <@davorg> Greg: 4 more hours
15:30  * Greg calculates
15:31 <@Greg> time for 13212 entries

15:33 <@DrHyde> well-designed castles have ver ver small windows
15:33 <@Trelane> davorg: I think we've got enough prizes
15:33 <@davorg> just big enough for firing arrows out of
15:34 <@Trelane> we've got 1 safari, 10 tshirts + 25notepads
15:34 <@richardc> and the daystar is ver ver big
15:34 <@davorg> Trelane: cool. i'll just give them to random nice people then.
15:34 <@marna> It would be very dark. Not so good for natural-light photography
15:34 <@DrHyde> Trelane: and four other books
15:34 <@hex> Trelane: but does that include The Prize Of A Lifetime?
15:34 <@Trelane> oh, and we've got four other books

15:35 <@marna> Dark is bad. Light is good. Sunlight is the best light. 
15:35 <@Greg> ohhh, the prize of a lifetime, i better enter some more

15:37  * davorg points out that rozallin's "here" is a long way north
15:37 <@rozallin> marna - you went meow bye and came in again
15:38 <@marna> Odd. And strange. And curious.
15:38 <@marna> Maybe the eviltypingpixies got me
15:38 <@Trelane> the evilty ping pixies?
15:39 <@DrHyde> Trelane: errm, [rummage rummage]
15:39 <@davorg> that's how i read it too
15:39 <@marna> Yup. They go about casting evilty on pings
15:39 <@DrHyde> Trelane: three volumes of the best of TPJ, and perl 6 essentials
15:39 <@Trelane> what three complete volulmes?  you mean like 3x3 books?
15:39  * rozallin points out that "long way north" is an island off the north west coast of Scotland.
15:39 <@DrHyde> no, all three volumes, once each
15:40 <@marna> Have you got a beach?
15:40 <@DrHyde> rozallin: what, canadia?
15:40 <@rozallin> Nah, Canadia is a boat trip away...
15:41 <@rozallin> In my village there's a pile of rocks in a bay that is called a beach - down south though there are some nice sandy ones.
15:42  * marna is desiring of a huge and sandy beach
15:42  * muttley has just come back from one
15:42 <@hex> Trelane: s/prize/shock/ # surely
15:42 <@marna> Or any sort of beach. London's *big* problem is the lack of beach. 
15:42 <@davorg> london has beaches
15:42 <@doop> Didn't they try to build one underneath a motorway junction somewhere?
15:42 <@pjcj> Paris has a beach.
15:42 <@marna> Not for swimming in salty water, though.
15:42 <@hex> And lovely it is too.
15:43 <@rozallin> And the great thing is, because there are so few people on nice days like this the sandy beaches are deserted.

15:44 <@Trelane> hex: buzz
15:44  * doop has swum in the Thames.
15:44 <@hex> I've been in the Thames up to my chest and it wasn't much fun.
15:44 <@marna> In London?
15:44 <+dipsy> It's the only place to be
15:44  * davorg never swims in natural water in the UK
15:44 <@hex> One day I will dare trying the Serpentine Lido.
15:45 <@Kake> I've swum in the Oxford bit of the Thames.
15:45 <@Trelane> I want to join that
15:45 <@marna> Hex! Saturday! They're all being wussy at me about it. I want to.
15:45 <@hex> Hmmm, I'm tempted.
15:45 <@DrHyde> the thames is alleged to be quite clean
15:45 <@Trelane> excellent, googling for serpentine lilo gives me a post to linux kernel
15:46 <@Trelane>  hyde park
15:46 <@marna> People keep saying that it's not clean. Spoilsports.
15:46 <@Trelane> no that doesn't help either
15:46 <@marna> lido, maybe?
15:46 <@DrHyde> marna: it looks dodgy because of all the silt
15:46 <@marna> It has boats to mow down swimmers, though.
15:47 <@marna> And it smells bad.
15:47 <@hex> marna: nah, the Lido is cordoned off. 
15:47 <@DrHyde> it smells of watery vegetation
15:47 <@marna> No, the thames.
15:47 <@hex> Oh, right.
15:47 <@Trelane> http://www.serpentinelido.com/
15:47 <@Nicholas> the THames has dangerous currents
15:47  * davorg might go to tooting lido this weekend
15:47 <@hex> My cakes have dangerous currants.
15:48 <@marna> Yes. I really don;t know what the currents in the Thames do, either. That would have to be investigated carefully.
15:48 <@Nicholas> that reminds me. the magic auto-refilling cookie jar is empty
15:48 <@Kake> Nicholas: Too hot to bake :)
15:48 <@Nicholas> swimming on the incoming tide might be the least worst plan
15:49 <@Dom2> (choccy flapjacks)++ # yum
15:49 <@marna> I am not playing in a water-bit that I don't *know*. 
15:50  * rozallin swum the length of the river cam once and got a cold so bad she doesn't want to swim in natural water ever again.
15:51 <@marna> I was swimming in the Cam last weekend. I was *lovely*!
15:51 <@marna> It was lovely, is what I mean. 
15:51 <@marna> A bit warm, though.
15:52 <@davorg> i'm sure_you_ were lovely too :)
15:52 <@marna> I was squeaking. There are pictures on the interweb....
15:53 <@davorg> pictures of you squeaking
15:53 <@Nicholas> how long is the cam?
15:53 <@marna> Probably. Although I might have been giggling.
15:55 <@sky> people swim in regents canal
15:55 <@marna> *Do* they? Hmmm.
15:55 <@rozallin> regets canal? is that the one near Camden Town?
15:55 <@Nicholas> dipsy: rule 1
15:55 <+dipsy> rule 1 is, like, people are stupid or the answer to many questions
15:56 <@sky> I saw people diving into regents canal
15:57 <@sky> you could swim the entire regents canal :)
15:57 <@sky> through the tunnels!
15:57 <@davorg> yeah regents canal goes thru camden (and thru regents park)
15:58  * rozallin used to work beside it :)
15:58 <@sky> then under angel, then is the border between islington and hackney and then out to the themes
15:58 <@Nicholas> do you swim the locks too?
15:58 <@sky> Nicholas: I have seen people bath in the locks
15:59 <@davorg> the locks get _very_ gungy
15:59 <@hex> Understatement of the day.
15:59 <@hex> Maybe they were pining for the fjords.
15:59 <@sky> I would not bath in the canal, nor the locks
16:00 <@sky> you can see the oil on the surface from above
16:00 <@hex> Also, Weil's Disease.
16:00 <@Nicholas> I suspect that locks are very dangerous. Certainly when in operation
16:01 <@hex> windows-- # how do people cope without virtual desktops?
16:01  * sky copes without virtual desktops
16:01 <@Nicholas> fun thing I remember was watching the dead things (even dead cats) floating down the Llangollen canal
16:01 <@marna> Oh! Cats should be alive....
16:01 <@Nicholas> the Llangollen canal feeds a reservior that supplies most of Cheshire
16:01  * Nicholas isn't surprised that marna reacted to that
16:01 <@sky> this is why I don't drink tap water
16:02 <@hex> (water filters)++
16:02 <@rozallin> hex - very badly. You begin to think that maybe you should upgrade your graphics card to support running more than one monitor, until you realise that linux can do nice things like virtual desktops....
16:02 <@sky> the reason I don't use virtual desktops is that they don't work when you have multiple desktops
16:02 <@sky> er, muliple windows
16:02 <@rozallin> But London tap water is lovely in comparison to the stuff up here!
16:02 <@Nicholas> where is here?
16:03 <@rozallin> Outer Hebrides of Scotland. The water comes directly from a loch so it's usually either brown with peat or yellow with... I don't even want to contemplate. Because of the peat it's slightly acidic, so it rots your teeth.
16:05 <@Nicholas> ooh. so I take it that you won't be making the social meeting^W^Wparty tonight?

16:08 <@Nicholas> 14:05 <@Nicholas> ooh. so I take it that you won't be making the social  meeting^W^Wparty tonight?
16:08 <@rozallin> no broadband/cable.
16:09  * DrHyde shudders
16:09 <@rozallin> it's either dialup, adsl or satellite.
16:09 <@sky> what is wrong with adsl?
16:09 <@sky> adsl is what I get london
16:09  * davorg gets spam from flirten.chatten@web.de
16:09 <@DrHyde> there's nowt wrong with adsl
16:10 <@Nicholas> sky: I'm not sure now, but before Sweden (and Finland and Austria) joined the EU, the north west of Scotland was the least densely populated part of the EU
16:10  * rozallin will have wireless broadband in london, hopefully.
16:10 <@Nicholas> so adsl may be harder to get there than in London :-(
16:10 <@DrHyde> "no broadband" implies "no adsl"
16:10 <@Nicholas> you're moving to London?
16:10 <@Nicholas> because we have more perl jobs than the Western Isles?
16:10 <@rozallin> If they figure out where they are going to put me. It was Islington now it's somewhere in Hackney.
16:10 <@rozallin> I'm going to University in London in September.
16:11 <@Nicholas> aha.
16:11 <@sky> ooo, where in hackney?
16:11 <@hex> How much does it cost to buy and install a ceiling fan?
16:11 <@rozallin> Homerton, or Bethnal Green
16:11  * davorg lived in Homerton once
16:12 <@rozallin> or they may change their minds and put me back in Islington again, or stick me in Tufnell Park or somewhere. *shrug*
16:12 <@marna> hex, we have two here and have not installed them. They cost about 100 each, but that's with halogen lights too. They are *shiny* and I need a day free to play with the leccy.
16:12 <@Nicholas> it's all up north. they don't have power up there, you know :-)
16:13 <@Nicholas> marna: here is work? or home?
16:13  * rozallin giggles.
16:13 <@hex> marna: hmm, interesting. Guessing you need an electrician to put them in? 
16:13 <@rozallin> I've never been south-of-the-river though.
16:13 <@marna> Here is home. Hence the me playing (or not, because I am too busy) with leccy.
16:13 <@marna> They *will* be in the livingroom.
16:14 <@marna> They are all aluminium and beechwood. 
16:14 <@Nicholas> rozqallin: I'm not joking. http://use.perl.org/~james/journal/13949  - just misrepresenting the facts slightly
16:14 <@Nicholas> marna: they will also move string to amuse the cats
16:14 <@Nicholas> ?
16:15 <@marna> No! There will be no cat-on-fan fun.

16:16 <@Nicholas> so what is marna? a junction?
16:16 <@davorg> there was a recent bunch of sniggering about 
16:17 <@davorg> a woman writing a perl book

16:17 <@DrHyde> davorg: liz wossname? ;-)
16:17 <@davorg> DrHyde: no. allison randal

16:18  * marna finds it safer to stay away from slashdot
16:18 <@davorg> marna: you're probably right
16:18  * rozallin gets slashdot news via rss feed through LJ. If there's a particularly good comment by someone in the /. forum she'll hear about it from someone.
16:19 <@Magnus> surely it's Antony and Declan, not Antony and Duncan
16:19 <@davorg> Magnus: aren't antony and duncan in some boy band
16:19 <@Nicholas> davorg: Allison is not the first woman to write a perl book. was there any fuss about http://perlwelt.horus.at/EasyBuch/ ?
16:19 <@Nicholas> marna: if girls can't be geeks, then is marna a junction (see perl6) of the two?
16:19 <@davorg> no, but it wasn't reviewed on /.
16:20 <@sky> Slashdot has said Leon has a nice jawline and would make a good girl
16:20  * davorg has a copy of that book
16:20 <@marna> branedim, clearly
16:20 <@doop> marna is a babe not a geek
16:20 <@doop> As any megahal kno
16:20  * marna slaps doop
16:20 <@Nicholas> no, marna is dangerous
16:20 <@davorg> there can be babegeeks surely
16:20 <@marna> I have photos of doophunting and I am not afraid to use them.
16:21 <@doop> marna is a geek! or a kitten! or whatever she wants to be!
16:21 <@Magnus> geeks cannot be babes
16:21 <@Magnus> babes cannot be geeks
16:21  * marna has the usual feministrant issues with the word babe
16:21 <@marna> Magnus, expalin your reasoning please?
16:21 <@marna> explain, I mean
16:21  * doop decides this is an argument to read over later in scrollback rather than participate in.
16:21 <@muttley> marna: can you do that by driving round on a motorcycle and running a bar in a strangely casablanca esque world?
16:22 <@marna> doop is very sensible
16:22 <@Magnus> babe = feminine
16:22 <@sky> what is a babe?
16:22 <@sky> hawt chix?
16:22 <@Magnus> geek is an artefact of extreme male brainness combined with not getting out enough
16:22 <@itz_> is the term ch1x0r offensive?
16:22 <@marna> and feminine cannot be geek?
16:22 <@marna> Nah. ch1x0r is funny.
16:22 <@Magnus> more to the point, can anyone find me American Juniors singing 'Kids in America'
16:22 <@sky> Magnus: that is not my definition of geek, yours is wrong
16:23 <@Magnus> sky:  no no, yours is wrong.
16:23 <@sky> no, yours is wrong
16:23 <@davorg> Magnus: surely extreme male brainess is all about being neanderthal and watching team sports
16:23 <@Magnus> hang on
16:23  * Magnus checks
16:23 <@Magnus> sky: no, yours is wrong
16:23 <@marna> Magnus, does your definition of geek allow for history geek or book geek or anything like that?
16:23 <@sky> no, yours is wrong
16:23 <@Magnus> marna: of course
16:24 <@Magnus> you can have female geeks
16:24 <@Magnus> female geeks cannot be babes
16:24 <@Magnus> sorry.
16:24  * rozallin thwaps Magnus with the Jargon File.
16:24 <@Magnus> they can still be pretty
16:24 <@sky> you are wrong
16:24 <@marna> But they cannot be 'hot'?
16:24 <@Kake> doop: Nobody here knows about LNR IS A BABE NOT A GEEK, or OXFORD IS BETTER THAN CAMBRIDGE IS BETTER THAN OXFORD.
16:24 <@blech_> Kake: I do.
16:24 <@Magnus> I should think that male geeks can see them as babes, too
16:24 <@Kake> blech: Freak!
16:24 <@itz_> I think geekness is related to Asperger's Disorder and there are nine males to one female with that conditiion
16:24 <@blech_> Kake: geek!
16:24 <@Magnus> but Cambridge IS better than Oxford
16:24 <@Magnus> itz_: yeah.
16:24 <@Kake> blech: Is it not only because I told you about it?
16:24 <@blech_> Kake: well, true.
16:25 <@Nicholas> nnoooo. give yourself over to the dark side
16:25 <@davorg> Magnus: nicer architecture in Cambridge
16:25 <@Magnus> seriously, can anyone find me American Juniors singing 'Kids in America' on MP3
16:25 <@Magnus> davorg: yup
16:25 <@Magnus> and it's not a proper city
16:25 <@Magnus> Oxford is a proper city
16:25 <@Nicholas> more than just tourists and students in Oxford
16:25 <@doop> Doesn't mean it shouldn't be propagated. Besides, the autolivejournaller started producing "me n sean n julietk n sean n julietk n julietk" when run on marna, which is almost the same thing.
16:25 <@Magnus> cambridge is a silly fairytaleland
16:25 <@Magnus> where time stands still
16:25 <@Kake> IANAG.
16:26 <@marna> So, apart from the male-brain-ness (which is another issue entirely, and a different argument) what qualities do you think a geek has, Magnus?
16:26 <@Magnus> YANAB, either
16:26 <@Kake> I so am.  I'm a Hot Bi Babe.
16:26 <@Magnus> obsessiveness
16:26 <@Magnus> nah you're a geek
16:27 <@Magnus> marna: lack of people skills
16:27 <@Kake> Oooh, (void) picnic.
16:27 <@Kake> I might gatecrash it.
16:27 <@sky> Magnus: you are just talking about nerds
16:27 <@sky> not geeks
16:27 <@Magnus> marna: affection for (void)
16:27 <@Magnus> sky: it's possible...
16:28 <@Kake> I can't be a geek; I'm not clever enough.
16:28 <@Magnus> geeks are cooller than nerds
16:28 <@Kake> I can knit though.
16:28 <@Magnus> they have the same obsessiveness
16:28 <@Magnus> geeks are more intelligent
16:28 <@Magnus> and possibly have better people skills
16:28 <@sky> see, nerds are geeks with the social problems
16:29 <@sky> then we have other geeks like james, who wears prada t-shirts
16:29 <@Kake> And Leon, who is a babe as well as a geek.
16:29 <@hex> Studmuffin!
16:29 <@Magnus> he's probably not a real geek then
16:29 <@Magnus> unless his mother bought it for him
16:29 <@Nicholas> dipsy: lnr
16:29 <+dipsy> Nicholas: i'm not following you...
16:29 <@Nicholas> mmm. dipsy doesn't think that lnr is a babe or a geek
16:29 <@Nicholas> dipsy: rjk
16:29 <+dipsy> Nicholas: sorry...
16:30 <@sky> someone who writes a new version control system must be a geek
16:30 <@richardc> or just certifiable
16:31 <@Nicholas> does james have a certification from klortho?
16:31  * Nicholas doesn't
16:32 <@Nicholas> good. that killed the conversation.
16:32 <@james> Oooo! Can I have a certificate! Please!
16:32 <@Nicholas> it was as interesting as dead camesl
16:32 <@Nicholas> dipsy: advice from klortho
16:32 <+dipsy> Nicholas: #11933 Because it's a syntax error.

16:33 <@Magnus> did bush think that Brazil was in Africa?
16:33 <@sky> brazil is in africa
16:33 <@sky> I think god split up the continents wrongly
16:34 <@Magnus> http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/text/bushmail.html
16:34  * davorg thought that plate tectonics split up the continents
16:34 <@sky> davorg: but someone made plate tectonics

16:35 <@davorg> don't start giving me that magic sky pixie nonsense
16:35 <@hex> Gondwana fo fana

16:36 <@sky> davorg: ok, I am sorry, I made the plate tectonics, and I did split up africa and south america wrong

16:58 <@muttley> *foo{CODE} = \&die; ?
16:58 <@Trelane> why do you want to undefine it?
16:58 <@mugwump> heh, what I'm trying to do is remove it to avoid inadvertant "sub foo redefined" messages
16:58 <@Greg> undef $subvar
16:58 <@Greg> ?
16:59 <@itz_> ewwww
16:59 <@mugwump> I could turn warnings off, but I couldn't guarantee that the module I'm requiring doesn't turn them back on
16:59 <@Trelane> turn off the warning in a begin block before and after?

17:00 <@sheriff> hi Joukey
17:00 <@acme> (modules@perl.org)-- # not a mailing list
17:01 <@sky> it is a mailinglist
17:01 <@mugwump> itz_: it's for a module that auto-loads other modules when their new() method is called
17:02 <@mugwump> Hmm, I wonder if XS is required
17:03 <@Trelane> are you trying to avoid the speed hit from leaving a proxy new method in place?
17:03 <@Greg> Perl is to object orientated programming, what ice hockey is to figure skating.
17:03 <@mugwump> no, the warning when the required file re-defines it
17:03 <@acme> sky: it should be mailing list on perl modules, not a namespace list which people ignore and are requested not to subscribe to
17:03 <@Trelane> mugwump: I don't think you need to redefine it, I think you just need to declare UNIVERSAL::new
17:04 <@mugwump> trelane: very good idea
17:04 <@Trelane> though perl might do some annoying method caching that could screw you
17:04 <@mugwump> I've also found that undef *foo works
17:04 <@Trelane> mugwump: ouch! there goes the rest of the typeglob
17:04 <@Trelane> let's hope they didn't have a $new
17:04 <@mugwump> trelane: yes, but the module isn't actually loaded yet
17:05 <@Trelane> hmm, fairy nuff
17:05 <@DrHyde> will someone be bringing a camera tonight?
17:05 <@Trelane> bad unmd5(e34dddb4abd0c6d8a5bc33c65fe8791a)!

17:46 <+dipsy> Right
17:46 <@Magnus> cool

19:49 <@davorg> someone complaining about all these "new players" forcing larry to change the language against his will
19:49 <@pdcawley> Bwah hah hah hah ha!
19:50 <@lathos> And Dan is fool enough to spend time arguing with the troll.
19:50 <@davorg> yeah. Dan agrees with you :)
19:50  * davorg watches pdcawley wade in
19:50 <@pdcawley> I'm in a foul mood. Need to vent.
19:51 <@itz_> I assume the BBC get too many appilications and the point of the web form is to reduce that number
19:51 <@itz_> they pay peanuts anyway
19:51 <@davorg> really :(

16:53 <@Kake> When it comes to ordering yarn over the interweb...

16:56 <@sean> LeathAARR!!!
16:56 <@hex> sean++
16:56 <@sean> StriNNGGG!!!  No, that doesn't work.
16:57 <@Kake> What's xemacs for "stop putting tabs everywhere you fuck"?
16:57 <@Dom2> scribot: "theo is a psycho" http://www.alternet.org/print.html?StoryID=16351
16:57 <@Dom2> Kake: (setq indent-tabs-mode nil)
16:58 <@doop> EWACKYPARSE
16:58 <@Kake> Neat, thanks.
16:58 <@Dom2> Kake: But do a custom-apropos for indent-tabs, you'll probably find a more permanent option
16:58 <@richardc> M-x untabify-buufer
16:58 <@richardc> is emacs for "kill those bastard tabs that snuck in"
16:58 <@Kake> Cool.
16:58 <@Dom2> Actually M-x custom-set-variable RET indent-tabs-mode RET nil RET
16:58 <@Dom2> should do the trick
16:58 <@sean> Also (setq default-tab-width 4) for example
16:59 <@richardc> no no no
16:59 <@richardc> you may set the indent width
16:59 <@Dom2> sean: ewwww!
16:59 <@sean> I may?
16:59 <@Dom2> sean: tabs are 8 space.
16:59 <@richardc> touching the width of tabs is evil and wrong
16:59 <@Dom2> listen to richardc - he speaks the gospel of truth
16:59 <@sean> :-P  It's *my* emacs and I'll do what I like with it
17:00 <@richardc> my emacs is really going to fuck your code over the first time they meet
17:00 <@marcel> richardc:  so what do you do if you don't like the tab width?
17:00 <@richardc> marcel: you indent it again using spaces
17:00 <@bob> yuo whinge on irc
17:00 <@sean> My windows aren't wide enough for 8-space tabs.   And you're not going to read my code anyway.
17:01 <@richardc> your bug is you're saying tab when you mean indent
17:01 <@sean> Plus those *are* spaces
17:01 <@marcel> richardc : so i do, but then a cow-orker told me off for doing that, saying he doesn't want spaces, but tabs.
17:01 <@hex> Dom2: no match for custom-set-variable on my xemacs...
17:01 <@marcel> hm. well, i like vi's tabwidth = shiftwidth = 4, using spaces...
17:01 <@Dom2> hex: Oh, well there should be something like it
17:01 <@richardc> marcel: kill him, stach the body somewhere, get on with working faster without the fuck
17:01 <@Dom2> hex: it's custom, how hard can it be? :)
17:01 <@sean> The problem I had with default emacs tabs was that it kept inserting spaces when I didn't want them
17:01 <@Dom2> marcel: Only set sw, not tw
17:01 <@Dom2> marcel: I use vim: set ai et sw=4 :
17:02 <@richardc> custom is different between x and gnu emacs
17:02 <@Dom2> richardc: No, gnu emacs has custom surely?
17:02 <@Dom2> richardc: oh, you mean didfferent implementation?
17:02 <@hex> Dom2: Ah, M-x customize-variable
17:02 <@lathos> People still use stallmacs?
17:02 <@Dom2> hex: that's the one
17:03 <@sean> people still get snobby about software?
17:03 <@Dom2> lathos: I switched when xemacs got tabbed buffers.  That's evil
17:03 <@hex> me++ # gradually learning how to use an emacs flavor
17:03 <@lathos> sean: Of course.
17:03 <@richardc> people still made out meat
17:03 <@blech_> People didn't switch to BBEdit when they got Macs?
17:03 <@hex> I don't understand how xemacs organises its tabbed buffers.
17:03 <@lathos> What are tabbed buffers?
17:03  * lathos uses xemacs in a terminal.
17:03 <@hex> lathos: A non-terminal thing.
17:04 <@Trelane> blech_: no, and we've had the discussion why
17:04 <@lathos> Ah, well.
17:04 <@Trelane> it's not electric
17:04 <@sean> friends are
17:04 <@sean> or are they?
17:04 <@lathos> I want electric sgml-mode.
17:04 <@lathos> jEdit does that, I guess.
17:04 <@Dom2> lathos: funny, I want to electrocute sgml-mode
17:04 <@Trelane> also, I like the AMAZING POWER OF LISP
17:04 <@Trelane> (tm)
17:05 <@richardc> Trelane: you're cracked
17:05 <@hex> What does this mean in practical terms?
17:05 <@hex> (error/warning) Error in `post-command-hook' (setting hook to nil): (wrong-type-argument arrayp nil)
17:05 <@lathos> sgml-mode is wonderful.
17:05 <@rjp> I prefer to program my editor in Ruby
17:05 <@lathos> Generally.
17:05 <@Trelane> richardc: aye ;-)
17:05 <@lathos> I prefer to program everything in Ruby.
17:05 <@Trelane> hex: something is broken, so it's been disabled
17:05 <@Dom2> hex: It means you said "nil" when you should have said "[nil]" ?
17:05 <@rjp> so do I, but the lack of Template still irks me
17:05 <@lathos> Template and Class::DBI.
17:05 <@lathos> (Although something recently seemed to fill the Class::DBI slot.)
17:06 <@hex> Dom2: Well, someone did when they did the default setup that came with my xemacs21. I don't know enough to cause errors like that....
17:06 <@richardc> Template, Class::DBI, and the aqueducts
17:06 <@hex> Trelane: d'you know where that post-command-hook would be, so I can fix it?
17:07 <@lathos> Amongst the reasons why we haven't all switched to Ruby yet are...
17:07 <@hex> TOO HOT
17:07 <@Trelane> hex: no
17:07 <@Dom2> hex: do man emacs, there should be an option to disable loading of exrtameous config files
17:07 <@hex> Dom2: OK.
17:07  * Trelane watches things compile
17:07 <@Trelane> it's kinda hypnotic
17:07 <@richardc> I was more thinking "what has Perl ever done for us?"
17:08 <@Dom2> richardc: Not given us Adam Hart-Davis, that's for sure
17:08  * lathos was deliberately conflating Python sketches.
17:08 <@richardc> Dom2: who he? is that a good thing?

18:13 <@Dom2> muttley: sounds like it's not in your kernel

18:18 <@Dom2> muttley: I suppose it's conceivable that you've got a MAKEDEV script that's out of sync with your installed kernel, but that sounds pretty unlikely
18:18 <@mbm> that would be very scary

23:49 <@_Dave> i read two really shite books on holiday
23:50 <@marna> What were they?
23:50 <@_Dave> one was just a bad pulp novel
23:50 <@_Dave> the other was worse
23:50 <@_Dave> sally army 20p jobs
23:50 <@_Dave> both had oriental angles
23:50 <@marna> I go away with backup emergency books in case the books I take are not what I want to read.

23:52 <@marna> Ouch!
23:52 <@marna> I once went to Galstonbury with a duvet and pllows and mattress, but we were driving down in a van.
23:53 <@_Dave> in a fiesta
23:53 <@marna> How many people?
23:54 <@marna> (me is thinking four)
23:54 <@_Dave> four
23:54 <@marna> That's a bit of a squidge, all right.
23:54 <@_Dave> did you sleep in the van?
23:54 <@marna> No - we had a tent. I was trying to take a bathroom as well, but the others stopped me.
23:55 <@marna> And a kitchen, for the production of fresh coffee.
23:55 <@marna> This year I settled for sleeping bags, an inflatable matress, and coffee-making things.

00:24 <@marna_> Oh dear.
00:24  * marna_ is alone with the cats and making *pretty* things.
00:24 <@rozallin> I posted a post in my LJ that had his name in it, and he replied. :|
00:25 <@marna_> He does that. Sean misspelled his name on usenet or somewhere and got a mail from him complaining.
00:26 <@Greg> marna_: did he spell it pwick?
00:26 <@marna_> I do not know, I'm afraid, Greggiekins.
00:26  * rozallin is sending him an email back, saying it's just a journal, so of course it's subjective.
00:26 <@Greg> anyway how is everyone

00:26 <@Greg> hot here
00:26 <@Greg> too hot to sleep

00:28 <@Greg> and the beads?
00:28 <@Greg> i find the best thing to do about midges is to drink enough that you dont notice them any more
00:29 <@rozallin> Think he has a script or something to find his name? My LJ shouldn't be available by google.
00:29 <@marna_> No. Beads are not evil.
00:29 <@rozallin> Especially not so quickly
00:29 <@marna_> He does have a script, I think. 
00:29 <@Greg> its very kibo ish
00:29 <@marna_> But in a very creepy way. Without the silly.

00:30 <@marna_> We could all start talking about him on mailing lists and usenet and journals all the time. That'd learn him.
00:30 <@Greg> yarr
00:30 <@Greg> or just further increase his over inflated ego
00:30 <@marna_> Not if we only said nasty things.
00:30 <@rozallin> That's kind of creepy and makes him look paranoid...
00:31 <@Greg> rozallin: remind me to introduce you to elaine sometime ;-)
00:31 <@Greg> elaine dated him briefly
00:31 <@rozallin> . (This doesn't include a conversation that myself and Randal Schwartz once held - that was amusing rather than offensive) :)
00:31 <@Greg> and i'd say it is understated to say she hates his guts
00:31 <@rozallin> Good job I didn't write anything bad about him :)
00:31 <@pjcj> I think he used to have scripts for that on usenet.
00:32 <@Greg> pjcj: at one point everybody had scripts for that on usenet
00:32 <@Greg> hence the kibo note
00:32 <@rozallin> yeah but - for LiveJournal?!
00:32 <@Greg> he has no life
00:32 <@Greg> remember hooters is a good night out for him
00:32 <@pjcj> I seem to recall him posting a RE to find his name including misspellings.  Might have been tchrist, though.
00:32 <@marna_> He must be incredibly paranoid, or egotistical, or both....
00:33 <@rozallin> I mean, sometimes I write about how if I were a serial killer I would hunt down people who buy ready cooked jacket potatoes from Tesco deli counters.
00:33 <@marna_> Lets all misspell his name in every possibly way all over the interweb and break his BRANE
00:33 <@Greg> rozallin: in your next LJ entry say that he contacted you, say its probably due to his insecurity, must mean he has a small cock
00:33 <@Greg> childish i know
00:33 <@Greg> but when in rome ...
00:34 <@rjp> after the Intel shenanigans, paranoia seems wise
00:34 <@rozallin> Randal Schwartz is stalking me!
00:34 <@Greg> i reckon we are 6mths away from randal publishing an open letter on a conspiracy theory to discredit him
00:35 <@rozallin> I wonder if he serches for merlyn too
00:35 <@rozallin> I wonder if he is here right now!
00:35 <@marna_> Greg. This is why you need an lj. To write this in. And piss him off.

00:53 <@Greg> blogs are evil
00:53 <@Greg> this is a journal
00:53 <@Greg> which means it will be filled with deep and powerful thoughts
00:53 <@Greg> or else some dim recollections of what happened the night before
00:53 <@itz> are you doing LJ now too greg?
00:54 <@Greg> fuck off ;-)
00:54 <@Greg> the day i do LJ is the day i do 
00:54 <@Greg> err i dont know
00:54 <@Greg> something really bad
00:54 <@Greg> teetotalism!
00:54 <@Greg> oh, how i'd miss those newkie brown ales with the label sliding off
00:54 <@Greg> that would be hell
00:55 <@itz> :P
00:55 <@Greg> plus i hear hacker groupies dig guys who drink NBA
00:55 <@ChrisDodo> AOL journal. you know you want to.
00:57 <@Greg> no i do not want to
00:58 <@Greg> i am already concerned with this rss feed stuff
00:59 <@Greg> scan-- # dont appear to have logitech products
01:00 <@richardc> rss is just so lazy folks can have netnewswire tell them you've updated stuff rather than having to fire up 20 web browsers
01:01 <@Greg> no, i'm more worried about some of the evil LJ folks integrating it there
01:01 <@Greg> people would start to think i did it
01:01 <@Greg> and liked LJ
01:01 <@richardc> ahhh
01:02 <@marna_> An ebvil lj foak might already have. greg_wisdoms
01:02  * marna_ hides from the wrath of the greggikins
01:02 <@richardc> Greg: quick, check your logs and serve a different page based on requestor
01:02 <@Greg> i've just seen a rechargeable wireless mouse
01:03 <@Greg> richardc: thats rather difficult
01:03 <@Greg> as my website is served by akamai
01:03 <@Greg> so i'd need to do something clever
01:03 <@Greg> as i have 15,000 servers caching it 
01:03 <@marna_> You cannot hide....
01:03 <@Greg> dig www.mccarroll.org.uk
01:04 <@Greg> it looks strangely similar to
01:04 <@Greg> dig www.whitehouse.gov
01:04 <@Greg> marna_: what url is this monstrosity
01:04 <@Greg> oh only 59 quid for the shiny mouse
01:04 <@Greg> i can almost justify that
01:05 <@richardc> surely akami must already have somemthing like that for embargoed news and stuff
01:05 <@Greg> we have lots of stuff to do that
01:05 <@Greg> but it would take an integration consultant to figure it out
01:05 <@Greg> let me qualify that
01:05 <@Greg> it would take a sober integration consultant to figure it out ;-)
01:05 <@Greg> i shall use the powers of ESI to sort it out later
01:06 <@marna_> http://www.livejournal.com/users/greg_wisdoms
01:06 <@richardc> :)
01:06 <@Greg> and add a p.s. i hate LJ to all LJ request pages
01:07 <@marna_> Oh. I forgot to make a comic about last night.
01:07 <@Greg> you missed the good stuff last night
01:07 <@Greg> where it all went wrong with tequilla and champagne
01:07 <@Greg> i think you missed it
01:07 <@marna_> I had to run away. Was there debauchery?
01:07 <@Greg> i didnt actually have the power of sight by the end
01:07 <@richardc> the restarant went very wrong
01:07 <@Greg> tequilla + champagne slammers
01:07 <@Greg> richardc: i decided the restaurant was going to be a bad move
01:07 <@Greg> so i made my excuses
01:07 <@marna_> Eugh! Did you *eat* anything?
01:07 <@Greg> what happened after i elft
01:08 <@Greg> left
01:08 <@richardc> it was, I wasn't even that hungry
01:08 <@Greg> the t+c was in the pub
01:08 <@richardc> that guy who talked too much was an ass
01:08 <@Greg> which guy
01:08 <@richardc> long hair, tall, broad face
01:08 <@Greg> a brummie?
01:08 <+dipsy> a brummie is north west right?
01:09 <@richardc> don't think so
01:09 <@Greg> hmmm
01:09 <@Greg> i have a vague recollection of being irked by someone at the restaurant
01:09 <@Greg> could have been them
01:09 <@richardc> he was to your right during the t+c
01:09 <@Greg> but its very vague
01:09 <@marna_> Long hair and tall could be lots of people.
01:09 <@Greg> ah yes
01:09 <@Greg> the vampire
01:09 <+dipsy> the vampire is http://www.buffy.com/ or http://www.buffy.com/home.html or http://www.activision.com/games/vampire/
01:10 <@marna_> Are there photies?
01:10 <@richardc> well he passed out in the toilets, so the waiers called him a cab
01:10 <@richardc> and jeff and I assisted him down the stairs
01:10 <@Greg> ouch
01:10 <@Greg> nasty stairs
01:10 <@marna_> This resturant will not be returned to?
01:10 <@richardc> at which point he declined to get into the cab or tell the cabbie where he was going
01:11 <@richardc> we made reparations
01:11 <@richardc> so yes, we can go back, but I'm fucked if I'm going with him about
01:11 <@marna_> No. Sounds like a right arse. Any idea who he is?
01:11 <@richardc> it got rather expensive
01:11 <@richardc> no, I'd recognise him again
01:12 <@richardc> but I have no name attached
01:12 <@marna_> We need someone with photies and captioning skills.
01:12 <@marna_> I think I'm glad I got all wibbly and had to leave....
01:13 <@Greg> sorry for leaving
01:13 <@Greg> it was just seeming like a bad idea to me
01:14 <@richardc> yeah, it was.  the food was very good as ever, but I only got to eat half of mine
01:15 <@marna_> What resturant was it?
01:15 <@Greg> red pepper
01:15 <@Greg> the old haunt
01:16 <@Greg> i probably owe someone for my starter
01:16 <@Greg> i cant remember i left cash or not
01:16 <@richardc> naah, you left cash
01:16 <@Greg> add an if in there somewhere
01:16 <@Greg> me++ # even when drunk i do the right thing
01:17 <@richardc> they were even good when I phoned them today to ask if they had my phone
01:18 <@marna_> Did they? Or have you lost your phone?
01:18 <@richardc> I've lost it
01:18 <@marna_> Oh bugger. Not good at all. 
01:18 <@richardc> I may try and call the bus people tomorrow
01:19 <@marna_> Have you lost your phone numbers and everything?
01:19 <@marna_> (sim card stuff)
01:19 <@richardc> meh. well all it's cost me is a downgrade
01:19 <@richardc> I've got them all bluetooth synced to me desktop at work
01:20 <@richardc> I may have them on my laptop too, but I won't get a new simcard till mid next-week
01:20 <@marna_> zat's not so bad then. Was it a very shinytoy? (and can you get insurance people to replace it?)
01:21 <@richardc> t68i, no insurance
01:21 <@marna_> Can you not walk into a phone shop and demand a simcard?
01:21 <@Greg> tbh, it should have cost you a downgrade i'd have played hardball and said ok i'll take the downgrade but at the end of the contract i'm leaving you're network
01:21 <@Greg> and you would have got the same phone
01:21  * ChrisDodo whispers mmmm shiny t610. look at the t610.
01:21 <@marna_> We have household insurance that covers phones and assorted other gadgets.
01:21 <@itz> the nokia 6600 has midp 2.0
01:21 <@Greg> next time i'm around near a landline if you want me to pretend to be you i'll get you the same phone
01:22 <@ChrisDodo> the nokia 6600 isn't out for ages.
01:22 <@richardc> no, I mean I kept my old phone, so I'll stick the new simcard in that
01:22 <@Greg> ah
01:22 <@Greg> well in a few days once i get the cert back from baltimore, SonyEricsson will owe me a favour and i can mention it to them
01:22 <@Greg> and no i'm not shitting you about here
01:22 <@richardc> I was on the phone and hungover and they said they'd post me a new simcard so I didn't think anymore
01:23 <@Greg> i'll spin a story about you being an opensource author who wrote something for their phone and wont be able to maintain it anymore
01:23 <@richardc> Greg: well if it helps there's my module on CPAN, and I've only 'compatibility tested' it on a t68i
01:23 <@marna_> Aha. Hungover is the worst way to deal with such things.
01:24 <@Greg> nah being hungover gives you an edge
01:24 <@Greg> just use the pain
01:24 <@Greg> use the disinterest
01:24 <@Greg> i often use my incompetence to my advantage in business meetings
01:24 <@marna_> Dulls the brane. Makes you say oh-kay to anything so as to get away and get more coffee.
01:24 <@Greg> well using the dulling for the disinterest/detachment advantage
01:26 <@richardc> I got quite a bit more work done that I normally would today what with using it to distract me from the feelings of impending death
01:26 <@marna_> Maybe I could have done with being hungover this morning.
01:27 <@richardc> I'd like a way for my hangover to kick in after I've travelled in

16:31 <@bob> del;ete it from tnhe repository
16:32 <@blech_> hex: also spelt cvs rm. Use -f if there's a file there as well.
16:32 <@bob> :)
16:32 <@blech_> Or use rm on the file first.
16:32 <@hex> blech_: Right.
16:34 <@richardc> and then commit the deletion
16:34 <@richardc> we had a guy here who was very surprised that he had to do that

17:00 <@Trelane> is there a version of memoize that works for objects
17:00 < webfiend> it's supposed to be a secret, richardc 
17:00 <@richardc> yes, it's called memoize
17:01 <@Trelane> won't that keep crap around even after I've disposed of the object though
17:01 <@Greg> yip
17:01 <@richardc> yes, so put a clener upper in DESTROY

17:09 <@blech_> Trelane: less hot? Where are you?
17:10 <@sky> you send a email to the hates-software mailing list, and it creates your blog for you
17:10 <@Greg> ah yes

18:14 <@Trelane> if I redefine cd in .bashrc as a function, how do I call the core cd?
18:15 <@itz> command cd
18:15 <@Trelane> excellent
18:15 <@fanf2> no builtin cd
18:15 <@itz> you aren't aliasing cd to ls as well by any chance?
18:15 <@Trelane> no
18:16 <@Trelane> I'm aliasing it to something that sets $WAS_HERE
18:16 <@fanf2> command is for executables
18:16 <@Trelane> so I can have an uncd
18:16 <@fanf2> use pushd and popd
18:16 <@fanf2> or cd -
18:16 <@Trelane> hooray!
18:16 <@Trelane> uncd () { cd - }
18:16 <@Trelane> done

18:18 <@sky> ksh should be killed
18:18 <@BradB> But I could be wrong
18:18 <@Trelane> well I'm using bash
18:18 <@sky> AIX has /bin/sh symlinked to ksh
18:18 <@Trelane> that's okay, it's only freaks like you who use aix anyway
18:18 <@rjp> cnb: what kind of phone?
18:18 <@itz> ksh is very much faster for scripting than bash and is more standard
18:18 <@acme> ksh--
18:19 <@Trelane> don't you feel dirty buying products from sco?
18:19 <@sky> Trelane: according the SCO, we are very illegal freaks
18:19 <@sky> SCO is demanding all AIX users DESTROY their AIX copies or RETURN them to SCO
18:19 <@fanf2> ksh is ok
18:19 <@Trelane> oh, how are you breaking the law this time?
18:19 <@BradB> PerfDave: Ur, I'm wrong. You can rmdir -- -, but cd doesn't support the same semantics
18:19 <@Trelane> really? why?
18:19 <@fanf2> better than solaris's ancient plain bourne sh
18:19 <@itz> the later kshs have nice features
18:19 <@cnb> rjp: T68i. Warranty service, b0rked keypad. got a brand new phone.
18:19 <@Trelane> sky: I think you should just not use aix.  use freebsd
18:20 <@Trelane> that doesn't seem to be breaking any laws this week
18:20 <@sky> we don't have much choise
18:20 <@sky> choice
18:20 <@Trelane> there's always a choice

18:20 <@Trelane> I've got another crazy idea for james

18:21 <@gellyfish> Rarr!
18:21 <@richardc> Trelane: it's being revived
18:21 <@itz> it would be OS dependent as well
18:21 <@Trelane> excellent
18:21 <@Trelane> itz: but it would have the features sky needs
18:21 <@PerfDave> Is there a way to mount DAV servers yet?

19:01 <@bob> Ranguard: wanna paste the passwords too?
19:01 <@Dom2> Ranguard: I find that small ssh-wrapper with symlinks is the best solution
19:01 <@kilinrax> tisk
19:01 <@Dom2> Ranguard: Then you get proper tab completion
19:01 <@lathos> Or just use zsh.
19:01 <@Ranguard> :)
19:01 <@bob> also you can add that sort of thign you your known_hosts file as well
19:01 <@kilinrax> isn't zsh a shell?
19:01 <@lathos> Yes.
19:01 <@lathos> Which has proper tab completion.
19:01 <@Dom2> where ssh wrapper is something like "#!/bin/sh\nexec ${0##*/} "$@"
19:01 <@Ranguard> bob: yea, know about that, but can never be arsed, I really should though :)
19:01 <@kilinrax> how's that going to help?
19:02 <@Dom2> lathos: I use zsh
19:02 <@lathos> For exceptionally scary versions of "proper".
19:02 <@Dom2> lathos: It's still easier to do the symlinks thing particularly where hosts files aren't involved
19:02 <@kilinrax> ah
19:02 <@Dom2> zsh rocks
19:02 <@lathos> Oh. I would tend to involve hosts files, especially known_hosts.
19:03 <@Dom2> known_hosts is not a bad idea actually, I should investigate that 
19:03 <@Dom2> But it's still easier to tab complete just the hostname without the hassle fo having to type "ssh" as well :)

19:18 <+dipsy> OK, Dom2.
19:19 <@itz> arent also GETs more likely to be cached (apart from SSLed ones)?
19:19 <@Dom2> yes
19:21 <@itz> hmmm wont SSLed GETs also appear in plain text on your own web server?

19:24 <@Trelane> email him and complain
19:24 <@Trelane> ;-)
19:25 <@mstevens> itz: the main risk I worry about with GET is the HTTP kind appearing in intermediate proxy logs
19:26 <@itz> if its SSLed if shouldnt be cached?
19:26 <@mstevens> itz: hopefully not
19:27 <@Dom2> It'll still get displayed in the browser's address bar however
19:28 <@itz> also in the history of a cybercafe public terminal
19:28 <@acme> if it's an action it should be a POST anyway
19:29 <@Dom2> Yeah, GET should be idempotent

20:17 <@hex> lathos: Do they have pervasive air-conditioning?
20:17 <@lathos> Not where I was staying, but they had pervasive fans.
20:17 <@hex> That helps.
20:17 <@lathos> Fans! Shit! That's what I was supposed to buy today if I wanted to sleep tonight.
20:18 <@Kake> After careful experimentation I've discovered that waiting for buses in sweltering heat is more pleasant than waiting for them in pouring rain.

20:19 <@Kake> Well OK, I'm going to worry about you now.
20:19 <@Trelane> it's these new busses
20:20 <@mstevens> the only way to not break yourself in this weather is to stay quietly at home and not move much
20:20 <@Trelane> they suck.  They have like four tiny tiny windows and no way to get better ventalation
20:20 <@Kake> I'm carrying at least a litre of water with me all the time now (two half-litre bottles in backpack pockets)
20:20 <@Kake> Ah, yeah, some buses are bad for ventilation.  The 74 isn't good.  Routemasters are ace.
20:21 <@Trelane> it's like the people who designed the busses never thought to test any aspect of it
20:21 <@Trelane> I mean, there's this invention that allows you to get airflow in old busses.  They're called 'holes'.  Now I know, that's not the technical term, but it's not rocket science.  A hole.  To let some air in.

14:50 <@davorg> *sigh* - http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=202723
14:54 <@lathos> That's rather tedious, but I see their point.
14:55 <@davorg> well yeah. but you can take things too far.
14:55 <@PerfDave> I dunno. Putting something in the "free" software package lists which isn't "free" by Debian's definition would be wrong.
14:56 <@Greg> can't we just appeal to SCO to order debian to keep the docs as is or else fire all the debian developers
14:56 <@Greg> or some such
14:56 <@PerfDave> Doesn't SCO own Larry now?
14:56 <@lathos> SCO owns everyone.
14:56 <@davorg> SCO owns everything
14:56 <@lathos> Oh, the joys of predictable set-up lines.
14:57 <@davorg> :)
14:57 <@PerfDave> If you don't care about such legal wranglings, you shouldn't be using Debian, really. It's one of the reasons I like the distro.
14:57 <@davorg> lathos: i've submitted the link to use.perl
14:57 <@Greg> bah, if we can't use SCO, then lets just make Acme::Current part of CORE that'll teach those debian fucks
14:57 <@davorg> PerfDave: it's one of the reasons why i don't use debian

14:58 <@AlexMc> don't understand, what's wrong with Debian. I'm not terribly familiar with that distro
14:58 <@PerfDave> AlexMc: They have principles. I think this is a good thing :)
14:59 <@Greg> debian is a great distro
14:59 <@Greg> they really dont have that many issues
14:59 <@lathos> davorg: Approved.
14:59 <@Greg> and if you want non-free stuff just turn it on 
14:59 <@PerfDave> It wouldn't make anuy operational difference to Perl in Debian, except for to the three people who refuse to have non-free apt sources :)
14:59 <@davorg> thanks
14:59 <@richardc> technically it's fine. politically they like to be whiter than white some times
14:59 <@Greg> i'd still rather use debian than redhat, suse, etc.
14:59 <@davorg> plus i found debian impossible to install the one time i tried it
14:59 <@richardc> PerfDave: you didn't read enough.
15:00 <@Greg> although i do like gentoo but thats only because i have a fast box to run it on
15:00 <@davorg> but i admit that may be a problem with me
15:00 <@Greg> it also supports everything
15:00 <@Greg> and the level of clue is fairly high
15:00  * Greg shrugs
15:00 <@Greg> i like debian
15:01 <@PerfDave> Debian is not trivial to install, but it's nice to keep maintained.
15:01 <@richardc> I like pie
15:01 <@PerfDave> I don't think I'd trust a server to any other Linux distro.
15:01 <@Greg> gentoo!
15:01 <@bob> you would trust a server to a linux distro
15:02 <@PerfDave> Greg: Yes, because it's so stable

16:08 <@gbjk> davorg: season 3 on dvd for 59 from dvd.co.uk - http://www.dvd.co.uk/product.asp?id=23562DVD
16:08 <@davorg> you think there's a chance i don't already have it? :)
16:08 <@gbjk> Season 1 & 2 from Canada for 36, region one though
16:08 <@gbjk> davorg: lol
16:09 <@davorg> btw, smiths currently has both buffy and angel season 1 DVDs for £19.99 each
16:09 <@gbjk> davorg: I HATE them for making me wait for S4 part 2
16:09 <@gbjk> davorg: The entire season for 19.99 ?
16:09 <@davorg> yep
16:09 <@gbjk> davorg: damn - that's good.... normally nobody's cheaper than dvdboxoffice.com for box sets
16:10  * gbjk has been good and is still waiting for SG-1 S6 to come out as a box set rather than buying individually
16:10 <@davorg> it's a special promotion
16:10 <@davorg> think it might be an error, given that angel S1 is twice the length of buffy S1
16:11 <@gbjk> http://www.xml.com/lpt/a/2001/11/14/xml-libxml.html ... another site advocating XML::Parser to start with

16:21 <@Elthek> Damn.  I thought that said "chess".
16:21 <@Greg> given that i've done my work for the day and can just hide the rest of the afternoon behind an out of office message

16:26 <@Elthek> Oh, this could be beautiful.
16:28 <@lathos> Bollocks, Fixation doesn't work on 10.3
16:29 <@Elthek> Mmm, poison.
16:30 <@blech_> Fixation?
16:33 <@lathos> FICS client.
16:33 <@Greg> curse you
16:34 <@Elthek> Greg: I wish I could checkmate lathos that quickly.  :-)  Good game.
16:34 <@Greg> if there is one thing going for me in chess
16:34 <@Greg> im  quick to beat ;-)
16:35 <@Elthek> Greg: Another?
16:35 <+dipsy> Another is probably working on the new 3D graphics engine at Argonaut
16:35 <@Greg> nah, thats ok for now
16:35 <@Elthek> okie.
16:37 <@Greg> we should set up a bot sometime to run an anonymous chess tournament
16:37 <@Greg> gbjk, lathos, yourself and i, all get guest names tell the bot, it draws up the schedule of games
16:37 <@Greg> and we see what if we can spot each other
16:37 <@Elthek> Heh.
16:38 <@Greg> gbjk would be easy to spot with his pinning obsession
16:38 <@Elthek> Why don't you just all turn up to the Mind Sports Olympiad in Manchester this weekend instead?  :)
16:38 <@Greg> [1] Manchester
16:38 <@lathos> Oh, bugger, is it the MSO?
16:38 <@Greg> [2] See Reason 1
16:38 <@Elthek> lathos: Yes.
16:38  * lathos tries to remember what's on this weekend.
16:39 <@Elthek> <http://www.msoworld.com/Olympiad/>
16:39 <@lathos> oxbridge.tat meet.
16:39 <@Elthek> Oh, pshaw.  Like you'd have more fun there than playing chess and go all weekend.
16:39 <@lathos> There is that. EPLACETOSTAY?
16:39 <@Elthek> They're reselling (nicest on campus) Uni dorm rooms, 23.50/night.
16:40 <@Elthek> Or I could maybe find you crash space.
16:40 <@lathos> I wonder if Mihoko and/or Masashi are going.
16:40 <@lathos> That would massively help.
16:40 <@Elthek> I've only got a floor in a tiny room for myself, so it's not tremendously easy.  Hm.
16:41 <@lathos> If any others of the go club are going, I will certainly go.
16:42 <@lathos> Oh, what about teh Heth?
16:42 <@Elthek> She's th***sing.  :(
16:42 <@lathos> Oh. Bad.
16:43 <@Greg> thesising?
16:43 <@Elthek> Hm.  The other alternative is that I skip out on my tiny floorspace and share a double room in the dorms, if you're interested.
16:44 <@lathos> Hrm, if Mihoko's going, I may well enter the pair go tournament. But then I'd have to wear a s**t.
16:44 <@Elthek> You would?
16:45 <@Elthek> The Go Olympiad is Saturday 10:30-7 and Sunday 9-7, by the way, or there's Rapidplay Saturday 10:30-7 only.
16:45 <@Elthek> The Go-Pair seems to be on Monday.
16:46 <@lathos> Rules: (4) Gentlemen should wear coats and ties at official Pair Go tournaments.
16:46 <@Elthek> Wow.  How pleasingly traditional.
16:47 <@Elthek> I wish chess had a little more honour to it.  :)

16:50 <@lathos> (3) Please refrain from trying to win on time when you have a lost game
16:50 <@Elthek> lathos: Well, I'll be there Friday and Saturday night.  I'm thinking about getting one of the dorm rooms anyway, so if you want to either share a double or just bring a sleeping bag and crash in my single, they'd both be fine with me.
16:50 <@doop> I lost all hope of learning to play Go about a fortnight ago when I watched someone spend two hours or so just explaining the etiquette rules to a beginner.
16:50 <@Elthek> lathos: Oh, wow.  Chess *really* needs that rule.
16:50 <@Greg> Elthek: no it doesnt
16:51 <@Greg> last minute races can be great fun
16:51 <@lathos> http://senseis.xmp.net/?GoEtiquette
16:52 <@Elthek> Greg: Hm.  I am undecided.  I think I agree for rapidplay games, and not for classical-length where it's far more of an insult.
16:52 <@Elthek> lathos: "Hang on.  Isn't Nigiri a type of sushi?"
16:53 <@rjp> "I like sushi"
16:53 <@lathos> Yes.
16:54 <@lathos> nigiru means to grasp.
16:54 <@Elthek> Thought so.  The page says it means "grip".  How's that related?
16:54 <@lathos> You grab a handful of stones.
16:55 <@Elthek> I mean, to sushi.  :)
16:55 <@Greg> is nigiri not the little rice cakes that have the fish 'glued' on with wasabi
16:55 <@lathos> You grip the rice to squeeze it into the right shape.

16:58  * davorg discovers that we're still processing logs for a site that closed down 18 months ago
16:59 <@lathos> Elthek: I may go for just the Friday and Saturday, because I've just discovered *another* picnic I'm booked at on Sunday.
16:59 <@acme> B and D. oh dear
16:59 <@Greg> still at least the army will take him
16:59 <@lathos> Elthek: How important is it to enter tournaments and stuff? Can I just turn up and expect to get a few fun games?
17:00 <@gbjk> Anyone got any links to help me using XML::LibXML's  XPath interface ?
17:00 <@Ranguard> with .jar files - should you put them all in 1 dir (I know nothing about java :) ?
17:00 <@Elthek> lathos: Hm.  Well, you can turn up and enter a tournament on the day; if you don't want to be too committed, the rapidplay (just Saturday) would probably be a good day for that.  I'm not too sure how just wanting random games would work; haven't been to an MSO before. 
17:00 <@davorg> his offer from sandhurst probably said "two grade Es and some blue blood"
17:01 <@lathos> Oh, I assume you would.
17:01 <@Greg> davorg: his offer from sandhurst probably said 'you are accepted'
17:01 <@lathos> have been before, I mean. OK.
17:01 <@Greg> and good for him
17:01 <@davorg> Ranguard: they all need to be directories on you CLASSPATH (or whatever it's called)
17:02 <@Elthek> I think you'd be pushed for time.  The chess games, at least, are usually spaced so that the absolute final time limit of the first corresponds with the start of the second.  So it'll usually be something like a game finishes an hour before the theoretical end, has half an hour of analysis by the players if they feel like it, and then people prepare for the next.
17:02 <@Ranguard> davorg: ok, cheers :)
17:02 <@davorg> oh, apparently harry worked hard for two crap grades
17:03 <@lathos> So expensive education really doesn't help fundamental stupidity.
17:03 <@Elthek> Oops, meeting now.  Back in a few minutes.

18:08 <@Greg> Autorarr would work

18:26 <@gbjk> richardc: Was it any good ( I'm asking this despite you saying it was canned - some things get canned despite being good )
18:26 <@Greg> what hell?
18:26 <+dipsy> hell is probably one of these $_) when it's at home??  Worse, while looking for it I discovered Perl's ..
18:26 <@richardc> it was watchable.  if you think Buffy is good you'll probably eat it up
18:26 <@Greg> do i have to read back
18:26 <@Greg> ah yes
18:26 <@Greg> it occured in paris
18:26 <@Greg> and then before that in munich
18:26 <@Greg> i dimly remember articles of incorporation
18:27 <@james> ah yes.
18:27 <@richardc> but generally, you'll have to make your own mind up

19:33 <@itz> touched by the hand of blog?
19:33 <@blech_> How can I go from an RT ticket page to all the tickets in that queue?
19:33 <@blech_> Oh, I CAN'T.
19:34 <@rjp> blech_: are you going to flounce out now?
19:34 <@blech_> rjp: no, I'm going to see if I can find out if Fotango are running a shitty old version of RT.
19:34 <@richardc> yaxu: you mean the horribly complex trackback system failed?
19:34 <@blech_> No, because it's not got a version number on the front page anywhere.
19:35 <@blech_> Or on the login page. Or anywhere else obvious.
19:35 -!- gbjk [~gbjk@mail.thermeoneurope.com] has quit []
19:35 <@richardc> surely you do what everyone does when you want to know about RT, you ask Robrt and he tells you he's meaning to upgrade it to rt3 :)
19:36 <@blech_> s/Robrt/james or someone/, but yes.
19:37 <@yaxu> trackbacks, heh
19:37 <@lathos> Rarr!
19:37 <@itz> mozilla++ # actually works now finally after years
19:38 <@lathos> blech_: You can. You hit "Search". (May not be obvious.)
19:38 <@yaxu> i coded a trackback receiver on runme.org a couple of months ago and not one person has blogged any of the pages
19:38 <@yaxu> either that or auto discovery isn't working
19:39 <@PerfDave> Trackbacks seem fairly pointless to me. If I want to make a point on your blog entry, I'll tack it on like an LJ / Slash comment, not write an entry in my own blog and stick a URL to it on yours.
19:39 <@lathos> Trackbacks are evil.
19:39 <@richardc> blech_: I'm talking about 2 different and specific RT installs
19:39 <@Greg> blech_: fancy giving me some mac pricing advice?
19:39 <@lathos> Technically, I mean. Bloody disgusting implementation.
19:40 <@blech_> lathos: yes, but then I have to deal with the big horrible badly laid out form, and I have to remember which queue I was in to boot.
19:40 <@yaxu> PerfDave: but you could say exactly the opposite
19:40 <@blech_> Greg: shoot.
19:40 <@yaxu> PerfDave: crappy comment systems are pointless when you can put the comment in your own blog
19:40 <@PerfDave> yaxu: Not really. With comments, I can always write a blog entry of my own and post the URL of it as a comment to your blog entry.
19:40 <@blech_> PerfDave: you can't comment on, say, the spool. We don't have comments.
19:40 <@PerfDave> It's more versatile.
19:40 <@Greg> i want to buy a dual 1.42? and 2 17" cinema displays (the flat screen ones), what should i be looking at spending on ebay for it
19:40 <@PerfDave> blech_: Well, you should :)
19:40 <@lathos> blech_: No, it should take you straight to the queue.
19:40 <@Greg> also is it 1.42 or 1.5
19:41 <@richardc> Greg: one million dollars
19:41 <@yaxu> PerfDave: that sounds fiddly
19:41 <@richardc> Greg: and see if you can pick up some sharks too
19:41 <@Greg> richardc: i was thinking more around 1,800
19:41 <@blech_> It is, and no idea, but they'll probably fleece you. Try Micro Anvika for reduced stock too.
19:41 <@yaxu> PerfDave: ok, trackback is also fiddly, but auto-discovery isn't for fiddly the user and seems to work
19:41 <+dipsy> okay, yaxu.
19:41 <@blech_> It's so new it won't be much cheaper.
19:41 <@Greg> hmmm
19:41 <@Greg> i may wait
19:41 <@itz> you can't generally get Apple discounts you have to grit your teeth and be seduced by the shininess as you hand over wads of money
19:42 <@Greg> until the clueless brethren of the mac fraternity feel their G5 is out of date
19:42 <@richardc> mmm, shiny
19:42 <@yaxu> PerfDave: also i don't want you writing comments on my webpage, and i don't want to write on someone elses, and give them control of my words
19:42 <@blech_> lathos: RT here seems not to do that.
19:42 <@PerfDave> yaxu: Comments seem to me to be more versatile, and encourage threading of discussions, which is a good thing. If every comment I ever posted on LJ, say, were a separate blog entry, nobody would be able to separate my comments from my posts and nothing would make sense to anybody.
19:42 <@PerfDave> yaxu: I don't see how allowing commenting gives people control over other people's words.
19:42 <@hex> YARG
19:43 <@blech_> Greg: just be sensible. Look at the Apple price, knock off a bit, and make that your limit. The amazing thing with eBay is that people don't do this.
19:43 <@lathos> richardc: Is there a File::Find::Rule->as_string or something for debugging?
19:43 <@hex> RealPlayer-- # "This is an infrequently occurring problem. Therefore a sulition has not been provided in this list." WTF???
19:43 <@yaxu> PerfDave: i write on your blog.  you can delete my post, or edit it
19:43 <@hex> s/sulition/solution/
19:43 <@itz> Apple kit is nicely packaged anyway
19:43 <@richardc> lathos: no, but there could easily be one in 0.20
19:44 <@yaxu> PerfDave: if you don't, i can libel someone and you get hassled by laywers
19:44 <@PerfDave> yaxu: That depends on the blog system. I certainly can't edit other people's on LJ (and if I could, you could always sign it). And I could delete a trackback you put on my blog as easily as I could delete a comment.

19:44 -!- iamcal [~bees@64.246.28.104] has quit [Quit: buh bye]
19:44 <@PerfDave> yaxu: As opposed to you libelling someone and making my blog link to it? :)
19:44 <@PerfDave> Or posting DeCSS code and making my blog link to it ;)
19:44 <@yaxu> PerfDave: you'd be less liable in that case
19:45 <@PerfDave> yaxu: Tell that to 2600 :)
19:45 <@richardc> PerfDave: don't just throw signing in there. it doesn't work prperly for mail, it sure as fuck won't work on the web
19:45 <@yaxu> PerfDave: you can delete the trackback, but not the original post
19:45 <@lathos> Oh, I'm a fool. Searching in Bryar works fine.
19:45 <@yaxu> PerfDave: i see your point of view though
19:45 <@lathos> But searching for things that aren't there doesn't.
19:46 <@itz> is there any distributed blog or wikki software?
19:46 <@PerfDave> yaxu: So it's exactly the same as you posting what you want in your own blog (where I can't edit or delete it) and posting a comment on my LJ which links to your post (which I can edit or delete)
19:46 <@richardc> itz: it's called nntp
19:46 <@yaxu> PerfDave: here's my main point though; blogs can be horrible, overindulgent things
19:46 <@itz> hmmm yeah maybe
19:46 <@PerfDave> I just don't see how a trackback is anything other than a subset of a comment
19:46 <@yaxu> PerfDave: in general they are hopelessly self-indulgent
19:46 <@PerfDave> itz: LiveJournal
19:46 <+dipsy> i heard LiveJournal was sexy, and the code is open-source or 'you're never more than two friends from a goth' or (see london.pm livejournals) or Bad and Wrong.
19:46 <@Greg> blech_: ok, thanks, i figure that a G4 with 2 17" flatscreen monitors is just about the sweetsot at the minute between leet workstation and sensible prices
19:46 <@richardc> whoa, my deja-vu drive really just kicked in
19:46 <@itz> perf: I was thinking more P2P
19:46 <@PerfDave> yaxu: What's that got to do with the difference between comments and trackbacks?
19:47 <@yaxu> PerfDave: if comments happen across several blogs then things centre around the discussion, and not a person
19:47 <@PerfDave> yaxu: You can comment across several blogs with comments as well as with trackbacks. You can link to discussions on other blogs. These things can happen perfectly well without trackbacks.
19:48 <@yaxu> PerfDave: better to have it automatic and standardised though
19:48 <@yaxu> PerfDave: otherwise software will have trouble tracing the thread for you
19:48 <@PerfDave> yaxu: No, because you're limiting the existing functionality to near uselessness
19:49 <@lathos> blech_: I think you're using an old version of RT.
19:49 <@yaxu> PerfDave: note also that trackbacks can ping anything, not just blog entries
19:49 <@blech_> lathos: I think so too.
19:49 <@yaxu> PerfDave: that's where the real potential is
19:49 <@PerfDave> What if you want to just shove a quick comment on somebody's post? There's no point writing your own post about it and backtracking, if it's just a one-liner, since it won't make sense to people reading *your* blog
19:49 <@PerfDave> yaxu: So can hyperlinks.
19:49 <@blech_> I hate whoever it is at Fotango who hasn't fixed RT too then.
19:49 <@blech_> PerfDave: you've never read the spool, have you?
19:50 <@PerfDave> blech_: Nope
19:50 <@richardc> blech_: according to darkuncle, hates-users.com was still free yesterday
19:50 <@richardc> and there's always hates-syssies
19:51 <@yaxu> PerfDave: well that's my point of view anyway
19:51 <@PerfDave> yaxu: That's OK, I'm fully prepared to accept that you're stupid ;)

20:02 <@lathos> Hello?
20:02 <+dipsy> bonjour
20:02 <@Trelane> hey, lathos, reading that you've been hacking around with bryar on lj
20:02 <@lathos> Yeah, I'm making it hurt.
20:02 <@Trelane> I was thinking about hacking in that parser stuff at some point
20:02 <@lathos> I'll be doing that later.
20:03 <@Trelane> okay, then I'll leave it up to you
20:03 <@Trelane> didn't want to do a load of work to find I'd only stepped on your toes
20:03 <@lathos> There's a lot of other structural changes I'm going to make to Bryar in the interim.
20:03 <@yaxu> hmm, trackback <-> nntp gateways
20:04 <@Trelane> lathos: what's an eta on those changes?  days?  Weeks?  Months?
20:04 <@lathos> I'm factoring pretty much everything I can out to base classes. See http://cvs.simon-cozens.org/viewcvs.cgi/Bryar/lib/Bryar/Frontend/CGI.pm?annotate=1.5
20:04 <@lathos> Tomorrow. This is all for a TPJ article that has to be out by the end of the week.
20:05 <@Trelane> ah
20:05 <@Trelane> oh that looks good and clean and stuff
20:05 <@Trelane> well, I've got more than enough to keep me busy until then
20:05 <@lathos> Yeah. I feel very silly for not having done it that way first time.
20:05 <@Trelane> good luck
20:05 <@lathos> TGa.
20:05 <@yaxu> richardc: do you think you will end up with trackback/nntp gateway as a by-product of your hacking?
20:06 <@yaxu> richardc: if you do i will clap
20:06 <@lathos> http://blog.simon-cozens.org/bryar.cgi/id_6450 # Aha.
20:06 <@richardc> yaxu: it's possible there'll be a trackback listener than creates mail messages
20:07 <@richardc> which will then wind up being in the archives, and so nntp browsable
20:07 <@yaxu> hee
20:08 <@Trelane> does anyone else find that using Word gives them writer's block?
20:08 <@richardc> but I might just go with the google for this url thing instead
20:11 <@tomboh> Trelane: yes, or any Word processor.  I spent a few hours with OOo this afternoon, and realised I should have used my text editor instead - it feels more natural.

21:39 <@acme> by hiting ingy with a big stick until hit releases a new version?
21:40 <@acme> or you can copy what i did, i imagine
21:40 <@Trelane> doh

22:36 <@mstevens> ali: someone you don't know
22:36 <@ali> OK

22:06 <@knew> i've only had to install a very small number of things manually so far, and that's because i need the absolute latest versions of them
22:06 <@PerfDave> knew: Even later than unstable or experimental?
22:07 <@knew> knew: not available at all as debian packages as far as i'm awarer
22:07 <@knew> s/knew/PerfDave/
22:07 <@knew> :)
22:07 <@PerfDave> knew: Ah, fair enough. Y'know, you could always offer to maintain them ;)
22:07 <@knew> other than that i'm on ttesting
22:07 <@PerfDave> Backporting packages is often useful if you want later versions of applications without compromising stability.
22:08 <@knew> two of them are firebird and ion, both of which have daily builds i update from every so often
22:09 <@PerfDave> Fair enough
22:09 <@PerfDave> firebird has a Debian package in Testing.
22:09 <@PerfDave> But I'm not sure how up to date it is
22:11 <@pjcj> So does ion (or maybe it's unstable), but it's only updated occassionally.  It was waiting on lua 5.0 IIRC.
22:14 <@knew> not sure either. also not sure if it's the xft version or not. as far as ion goes, it's a march build in testing at least, so that's a long way out of date
22:14 <@PerfDave> What is ion?
22:14 <+dipsy> ion is another window manager at http://www.students.tut.fi/~tuomov/ion/
22:14 <@PerfDave> Thanks, dipsy 
22:14 <+dipsy> PerfDave: de rien
22:15 <@knew> then of course there's rdesktop. need the cvs copy of that to get 24bit colour
22:15 <@Greg> never trust the finns, they steal telecoms ideas from the industrious swedes who always invent things first but do not have the brash nature to release them first - at least thats what i was told by several ericsson employees
22:16 <@PerfDave> Have you googled for "rdesktop experimental debian package" or similar? There are a few experimental repositories built from CVS
22:16 <@kungfuftr> tightvnc++
22:17 <@Kai> anyone know of a way of recording desktop usage to an mpeg say? besides actually setting up a video camera?
22:17 <@kungfuftr> also, don't use debian packaged mozilla... just use the net installer on the mozilla.org site
22:17 <@kungfuftr> Kai-> win32 or X?
22:17 <@Kai> X
22:18 <@Kai> what win32 are there btw?
22:18 <@Kai> i've search and not found...
22:18 <@rjp> kai: lotus screencam springs to mind
22:18 <@knew> kungfuftr: i use firebird anyway, which is just an extract and run. no installation other than placing in a suitable location required
22:18 <@kungfuftr> there's an output plusing for X iirc that just shoves everything into a file for encoding
22:18 <@rjp> http://www.lotus.com/products/screencam.nsf
22:18 <@kungfuftr> knew-> aye, that'll change on the 1.5 roadmap installer though
22:19 <@PerfDave> Why wouldn't you use the Debian packaged Mozilla or Firebird?
22:21 <@Kai> rjp: ah, but nothing for X...
22:21 <@PerfDave> Kai: Is there anything in the imagemagick suite?
22:21 <@Kai> kungfuftr: output plusing? that correct?
22:22 <@knew> Kai: if you're not insisting on mpeg, how about using vnc in combination with vnc2swf?
22:23 <@kungfuftr> PerfDave-> debian packages break a lot of mozilla stuff...
22:23 <@kungfuftr> Kai-> moo?
22:25  * Kai was on phone
22:25 <@Kai> kungfuftr: moo?
22:25 <+dipsy> somebody said moo was Mud Object Orientated or the sound that cows make
22:26 <@knew> i seem to recall someone on the list (richardc probably) recently saying something about how debian doesn't do perl properly and best to install a non-debian copy of it. am i remembering right?
22:26 <@knew> was in combination with apache and mod_perl i thihnk
22:29 <@kungfuftr> but mozilla installs into a single directory anyway, so not much reason to worry about having it package maintained
22:30 <@kungfuftr> that and because i have about 20 different versions of mozilla installed here
22:31 <@knew> whilst i was reinstalling today i found an extension that won't install into a profile directory, and also insists on the user running moz having write access to it's folder or else moz just won't appear :(
22:33 <@PerfDave> kungfuftr: Such as?
22:33 <@kungfuftr> PerfDave-> every copy since 0.8 including alpha's betas and  full releases, plus my devel copy
22:34 <@PerfDave> kungfuftr: What do they break?
22:34 <@mstevens> yay, I have pizz0r
22:34 <@kungfuftr> PerfDave-> i've seen it over-ride profiles on several occasions
22:35 <@PerfDave> kungfuftr: What do you mean by that?
22:35 <@kungfuftr> it will install it's "default" profile over your own, which then removes all your bookmarks and psm stuff, etc
22:35 <@PerfDave> I've never had a problem with that.

00:12 <@Andy> Tom Waits for Lathos.
00:12 <@doop> I have an O'Reilly book sitting here with a picture of some haemorrhoids on the front.
00:14 <@lathos> Is that the web services one?:
00:14 <@Andy> XML-RPC
00:14 <@doop> No, that's a spiny lobster. It's the SOAP one upside-down.
00:14 <@ChrisDodo> web services one any good?
00:14 <@lathos> Well, there's always the old joke about the GNU emacs one.
00:16 <@doop> ChrisDodo: I was able to get the gist of things pretty quickly and code up some useful stuff, but it was a bit out of date and probably always will be by the time it hits print. Also, a lot of it was Java source code filler.

00:48 <@ali> knew: ewtikins?
00:49 <@ali> sky: Oh, that's good
00:49 <@sky> I was at the talk where I spoke about ponie, yes
00:49 <@mstevens> ali was there too, IIRC
00:50 <@mstevens> although she might have arrived late. I'm not sure.
00:50 <@ali> I think I arrived a bit late and achieved a passable state of being human only after a beer

00:55 <@sky> i had a ponie t-shirt
00:56 <@ali> last one at Calthorpe Arms
00:56 <@knew> ali: ta. added her to my list now :)
00:56 <@gellyfish> Rarr!
00:57 <@sky> the calthorpe arms sucks
00:57 <@gellyfish> I thought so

00:57 <@mstevens> lathos: it's like a sourceforge project and a mailing list, you create them before you start coding
00:58 <@gellyfish> Hmm
00:58 <@ali> sky: and your suggestion for a different pub?
00:59 <@ali> Remember, it has to be both south and north at the same time, be about 10 seconds from a tube station, have wonderful food, 50 different beers (and ciders) and wireless.
00:59 <@mstevens> ali: my suggestion is still the cittie of yorke
01:00 <@ali> oh, and _decent_acoustics_
01:00 <@mstevens> ali: don't forget room for 30 people 
01:00 <@mstevens> at no cost
01:01 <@sky> calthorpe isn't wireless
01:01 <@lathos> So, Porterhouse for next time, then?
01:01 <@sky> the angel
01:01 <@sky> works for me
01:01 <@mstevens> lathos: too loud, too packed
01:01 <@lathos> That wasn't in the spec.
01:01 <@sky> calthorpe sucks really bad
01:01 <@ali> where is the angel?
01:01 <+dipsy> it has been said that the angel is on tv or so dreeeeemy or a deus ex machine or spun off or a series worth watching
01:01 <@sky> ali: old street
01:01 <+dipsy> somebody said old street was just down the street, really
01:02 <@ali> hrm, the room was too small to be the One True Pub. Next!
01:02 <@sky> nah
01:02 <@ali> and did they do food?
01:02  * sky is happy to have his ponie meetings at wenlock arms
01:03 <@sky> yes theyd o
01:03 <@sky> yes, the angel has good
01:03 <@sky> food
01:03 <@gellyfish> and a very good pub it is too
01:03 <@mstevens> sky: yes, but the wenlock arms starts being bad as soon as you take 6 people there
01:03 <@sky> I know
01:03 <@sky> gellyfish: which one?
01:03 <@gellyfish> the angel
01:03 <@sky> mstevens: HOWEVER THE PONIE BEER TEAM IS NEVER GOING TO BE MORE THAN 6 PEOPLE OR I WILL SHIT MY PANT
01:04 <@gellyfish> you have a single PANT
01:04 <@gellyfish> does this mean you had a leg amputated
01:04 <@sky> PANTS
01:04 <@gellyfish> and does it mean if you shit yourself it run down your leg easier

20:37 <@itz> installing linux in 1994 was easier than gentoo
20:38 <@Greg> gentoo++ # half the fun is the difficulty
20:39 <@Greg> gentoo++ # even better if you run your gentoo box 3000 miles away in north carolina
20:39 <@Greg> me++ # slightly insane
20:39 <@itz> LOL
20:39 <@pdcawley> itz: No it wasn't.
20:39 <@itz> pdcrawley: which distro did you use?
20:39 < gilc> heh
20:39 <@pdcawley> distro?
20:39 < gilc> gentoo sucks :/
20:39 <+dipsy> distro is probably one .tar.gz file, a bundle can contain references to many
20:39 <@Greg> slackware was the first i remember
20:39 <@Greg> but i cant remember if it was about in 94
20:39 <@pdcawley> Distro? Where we're going we don't have distros
20:39 <@Greg> i think it was
20:40 <@itz> MCC interm 0.99 was easier
20:40 <@pdcawley> First distro was the MCC interim distro.
20:40 <@pdcawley> Whcih was tedious.
20:40 <@Greg> it definetly was available 95~96
20:40 <@itz> I liked it
20:40 <@pdcawley> And Soft Landing Systems came before Slackware.
20:40 <@itz> emacs and gcc and it fitted on 9 x 3.5" disks
20:40 <@pdcawley> But I have installed from a boot/root disk and a bunch of TGZs rawrited to the disk.
20:41 <@pdcawley> Before MCC was available.
20:41 <@itz> I installed coherent on a 8086 before linux existed
20:41  * pdcawley remembers patching the kernel to get the right root disk...
20:41 <@itz> that was easier than gentoo as well
20:41 <@pdcawley> Ah. I never went with coherent.
20:42 <@itz> it was fairly bollox to be honest
20:42 <@pdcawley> Has Gentoo got harder or something?
20:42 <@pdcawley> It never struck me as hard, just slow.
20:42 <@pdcawley> But if you want custom builds, what do you expect?
20:42 <@itz> well its the realisation that I can't trust the install scripts
20:43 <@claes> heh, it takes like 2 minute to xref perl-5.8.0 on my powerbook =(
20:43 <@pdcawley> itz: Hmm?

20:53 <@claes> wow, CGI.pm 3.0!
20:54 <@itz> one basic flaw of portage is the lack of a "fallback" file URL if the original goes 404 (like BSD has)
20:55 <@itz> I cant install grub via portage either since FSF have reorganised alpha.gnu.org

21:33 <@Greg> yes, but on the dole you have a chance to work

21:34 <@kungfuftr> =0)
21:34 <@Greg> no, anyone who can get that contract can get permie in london
21:34 <@Greg> and after NI (employers), lost hours due to sickness/leave over a year, accountant costs, they will be much worse off
21:36 <@Greg> still disagree kungfuftr

22:15 <@Kake> Breakfast really is a case of throw something in foil, leave house.  I got up at 0630 today and was out of the house before 0650, and that's including a bath (a small one because there was no hot water but nevertheless a bath)
22:15 <@Greg> or at least what it appears like to the uninformed reader
22:16 <@Nicholas> greg: confused now.
22:16 <@Kake> Nick: Sick days/holidays/etc mean you end up with 25K/year equivalent not 36K/year
22:16 <@Nicholas> and everyone else will get pissed off with repeating stuff on channel. *probably)
22:16 <@Nicholas> aha right
22:17 <@Nicholas> wohohoho. yes. cheapskates
22:18 <@itz> excessive of programmers + no work = low rates :(
22:18 <@bob> hmm mastermind just doesnt seem the same without magnus magusson
22:18 <@itz> ^ excess
22:19 <@Greg> yeah, but 25k without training/career development makes driving a tube train look good
22:19 <@kungfuftr> heh, another few months of unemployment and i'm off to the army
22:19 <@Greg> for far more money
22:19 <@Nicholas> sainsburys++ # Theaksons Old Pecular on special
22:19 <@Nicholas> Piccadilly line-- # delays never need to be on special
22:19 <@itz> greg: have you looked at jobserve recently 25K is fairly common
22:19 <@Greg> i have *large* amount of booze arriving from sainsburys soon as we got sick of going to the overpriced local offie
22:19 <@Nicholas> for that level of requirements?
22:20 <@Greg> itz: yeah, but with no stability, pension, perks, training
22:20 <@Greg> it doesnt look that good
22:20 <@Greg> 25k is fine
22:20 <@Greg> but not without the other bits
22:20 <@itz> pension? hahaha
22:21 <@Nicholas> contributory pension represents a way to get more money out of your employer
22:21 <@Nicholas> and money out of the taxman
22:21 <@Nicholas> oops. s/$/non-/ - even better way to get ...

22:22 <@kungfuftr> a union i say!!! a union of programmers!
22:23 <@Greg> anyway the point remains, i think some people will find it interesting to look at my analysis of the rate
22:23 <@Greg> to see what contractor vs. permie really means at low rates
22:23 <@Nicholas> as best I can tell permie jobs still exist
22:24 <@Nicholas> the bottom hasn't fallen out of permie jobs in anything like the same way as contracts
22:24 <@Nicholas> but I'm not really looking, so feel free to correct me
22:24 <@itz> very few and at  low salaries
22:24 <@ChrisDodo> url for london.food?
22:24 <+dipsy> well, london.food is http://thegestalt.org/mailman/listinfo/london.food
22:24 <@Greg> nah, when i looked recently i had 3 job offers in as many days
22:24 <@Greg> i dont think the market has dropped too badly
22:24 <@Greg> at least there is still a bottom
22:24 <@Greg> but i do think that the bottom level of contractor jobs are really screwing people
22:25 <@DrHyde> there's permie jobs out there. they don't pay silly salaries any more.
22:25 <@itz> summer is a slack season anyway
22:25 <@ChrisDodo> dipsy lies.
22:25 <+dipsy> ChrisDodo: huh?
22:25 <@ChrisDodo> dipsy-- #liar
22:25 <+dipsy> ChrisDodo: huh?

22:28 <@Nicholas> week today
22:28 <@bob> indeeed
22:28 <@TeeJay> dipsy: seen mugwump?
22:28 <+dipsy> mugwump was last seen on #london.pm 2 hours, 43 minutes and 5 seconds ago, saying: mmm, broccoli [Mon Aug 18 17:41:04 2003]
22:29  * TeeJay scoffs at the idea that there are jobs anywhere you can afford to buy a house
22:30 <@Nicholas> only match I'm aware of is "in your dreams"
22:30 <@Nicholas> sadly
22:31 <@TeeJay> ackshully 'up north' they have jobs and affordable housing
22:32 <@TeeJay> but I suspect their is a small but insurmountable gap between pay and house prices
22:32 <@Nicholas> ultimately I didn't like Newcastle because it was too damn far away from everyone I knew
22:32 <@TeeJay> and more importantly its 'up north' and lets be honest we'd all rather be broke and live in the south
22:32 <@TeeJay> we they speak properly
22:32 <@TeeJay> and don't smell of coal mines
22:32 <@TeeJay> and don't vote for the BNP
22:33 <@TeeJay> (except tower hamlets.. but I don't think any of us want to live there either)
22:33 <@Nicholas> I believe that they speak properly in Edinbrugh
22:33 <@Nicholas> and don't vote for the BNP
22:33 <@Nicholas> and the pubs have much longer opening hours
22:33 <@Nicholas> and the beer is good
22:33 <@TeeJay> Nicholas: but its full of scottish people

22:34 <@Nicholas> I don't remember it being full of drunk, bad smelling people
22:35  * TeeJay is just judging by the trains and busses he's experienced in scotland or that have passed thru scotland
22:35 <@TeeJay> shetland doesn't count as scottish as they try very hard to be vikings
22:35 <@TeeJay> and any mainland scots are mocked as wet southern mainlanders

22:43 <@ChrisDodo> kake, london.food url?
22:44 <@TeeJay> right offline time again
22:44 <@Kake> It doesn't have a real URL at the moment, but I will dig out Roger's archive link,\
22:44 <@TeeJay> DrHyde: back from eastern europe then?
22:44 <@DrHyde> ooh, ooh, it has "an amazing array of features which make shopping easier and more fun"! now i must install it! i want to have fun in eTscoids!
22:44 <@ChrisDodo> ah. it's for changing my mailing options
22:44 <@TeeJay> laters all
22:44 <@Kake> http://lists.firedrake.org/london.food/
22:44 <@DrHyde> TeeJay: yes, the beer was very nice and very cheap
22:45 <@Kake> Oh, right - the list is running on siesta now, so I guess go to CPAN and read the docs to see if/how you faff with it via mail.
22:45 <@bob> or indeed just hassel simon
22:45 <@ChrisDodo> ok. I'll let out a little JEESUS. And go read the docs.
22:46 <@ChrisDodo> please god tell me siesta is having a web frontend for this sorta thing?
22:46 <@Kake> I believe umpteen people promised to write one and then didn't.
22:46 <@bob> ChrisDodo: it does
22:46 <@DrHyde> ChrisDodo: i think it has one now. i find it confusing.

10:18 <@sky> hi
10:18 <@sky> soon to be non free man
10:19 <@Ranguard> :)
10:19 <@Ranguard> 3 days and counting :)
10:21 <@sky> tesco++ online groceries
10:23 <@Kake> sky: If you like online grocery shopping, and you like vegetables, check out http://www.abel-cole.co.uk/
10:23 <@sky> oooooo
10:23 <@sky> I do most of my green stuff shopping at fresh & wild
10:23 <@Greg> Ranguard: if i were you i'd be getting nervous right now
10:23 <@Kake> Mixed organic vegetable box every week.  I used to order from them until I started spending random time away from home.
10:24 <@Greg> Ranguard: does kerry take long to get ready?
10:24 <@sky> bah
10:25 <@sky> why isn't there any game to buy in this freaking country
10:25 <@sky> except venison
10:25 <@Kake> Oh, damn, I want to have vegetable boxes again now.
10:25 <@Greg> i know a very good supplier of venison
10:25 <@Greg> let me know if you want me to send you their menu next time it drops through the post
10:26 <@Kake> Does boar count as game?
10:26 <@sky> yes, boar is game
10:26 <@Kake> You can get boar from borough market.
10:26 <@sky> venison is cheaper than beef
10:27 <@sky> Greg: please do
10:27 <@Kake> I like the venison stall at borough market too.  Steaks etc, plus smoked venison, venison jerky, venison pies.
10:28 <@sky> I need to hit the fish market
10:29 <@Kake> There is apparently a very good fishmonger in Essex Road; I must get around to visiting.  Maybe this weekend.  It is within spitting distance of SPS.
10:30 <@sky> SPS?
10:30 <+dipsy> SPS is st peter's street, where Trelane and richardc live or tel 72268046
10:30 <@sky> ooo
10:30 <@sky> that is close by me
10:31 <@sky> so where would I go if I wanted really good game, like bear or elk
10:31 <@Greg> unlikely to get bear
10:31 <@Kake> http://www.deliaonline.com/ingredients/goodfoodstores/s_0000000335.asp
10:32 <@Greg> also elk is fairly swedish/northern
10:32 <@sky> Greg: I meant some place that imports stuff
10:33 <@Kake> sky: Why are you not on the london.food mailing list? :)
10:33 <@sky> I had no idea such one existed

10:34 <@Ranguard> Greg: yea, been fine until this week, nerves starting to kick in now :)
10:35 <@Greg> Ranguard: so does kerry take long to get ready?
10:35 <@Ranguard> Greg: she's got the hair dresser at 9am - wedding isn't until 3:30 - so I think she'll be ready :)
10:35 <@Greg> but in general, when you are sitting on the sofa waiting does she take a while
10:35 <@sky> nani spent from 9 to 2.30 at the hairdresser
10:35 <@Ranguard> Greg: she's not bad.. but smetime
10:35 <@sky> er, 1.30
10:36 <@Greg> yeah, the hair dresser can eat a lot
10:36 <@Greg> of time
10:36 <@Greg> and of course near the time of her leaving everyone pops in to slow her down
10:36  * Kake tries to remember whether she brushed her hair for her wedding.
10:36 <@Greg> even though she has left what should be enough time
10:36 <@Greg> gosh Ranguard, these little delays can seem much longer when sitting at the front of a church you know
10:37 <@Ranguard> Greg: it's all at the hotel, so no delays from traffic or anything
10:37 <@Greg> oh thats even worse!
10:37 <@Greg> lots of people popping in to wish her luck
10:37 <@Ranguard> Greg: I've said she can be 10 mins late - but no more :)
10:37 <@Greg> it wont be her fault, poor girl
10:37 <@Greg> she will just be being polite
10:37 <@Greg> but everyone will want to wish her luck
10:38 <@Greg> and she could be so delayed
10:38 <@Greg> and you sitting at the front waiting
10:38 <@Ranguard> heh, thanks for the support and trying to calm me down... oh.. actualyl that's not what your doing... :)
10:38 <@Greg> gosh, i'd be nervous if i were you leo, wouldn't you sky?
10:38 <@Kake> Greg is evil.
10:38 <@sky> bad greg
10:38  * Ranguard grins
10:38 <@sky> just do what I did, drink a lot of bubbly stuff
10:38 <@Greg> i wasnt allowed to
10:38 <@Greg> ron asked that i was sober for the wedding
10:39 <@sky> I was sober!
10:39 <@Kake> I suppose that is not an unreasonable request.
10:39 <@Ranguard> I'll have a medicinal shot or two - but the morning will be spent in my dad's jacuzi :)
10:39  * sky slept to 11.30 on the day of his wedding
10:40 <@sky> then drove crazy around stockholm until my limo friend arrived and I could just relax
10:40 <@Greg> i seem to recall a big fry up, then we went bowling
10:40 <@Greg> better than a friends wedding when i took him out to play golf
10:40  * sky is trying to convince him to move to London so I can get some decent limo bling bling service here
10:40 <@Greg> and we got back with an hour to spare when it was revealed the shoes he had worn for golf were the ones he was wearing for the service
10:41  * Ranguard is borrowing a mercedes from work to drive down in :)
10:42 <@sky> I should really, hmm, walk down to work
10:42 <@sky> this is annoying, why aren't there teleporters
10:45  * Greg heads off to a meeting in town which will involve hassle

11:21 <@Jouke> morning
11:23 <@davorg> anyone know a good way to break into an AOL email account?
11:23 <@davorg> a friend suspects her boyfriend is being unfaithful and would like to read his email
11:24 <@davorg> not that i condone such things obviously
11:24 <@davorg> but i told her i'd ask :)
11:24 < webfiend> I think it would be easier just to get some friends to beat him up.
11:24 < webfiend> You know, on general principle
11:24 <@muttley> I think there's a cross site scripting attack from AOL mail
11:24  * CPAN upload: POE-Component-Client-HTTP-0.57 by RCAPUTO
11:24 <@muttley> web mail that is
11:24  * CPAN upload: Sys-Hostname-FQDN-0.04 by MIKER
11:24 <@muttley> but it's a long shot and has probably been close
11:25 <@lathos> davorg: If it's got to that stage of paranoia, she might as well just assume that he is.
11:25 <@muttley> otherwise the mail is (or was) held in plain text in the config file
11:26 <@davorg> should i be worried that my friends see me as a l33t haxx0r who can do things like this :)

11:27 <@muttley> davorg: to them, all technology is indistuinguishable from magic
11:27 <@muttley> some of the stuff you do probably does look like magic
11:27 <@davorg> and i'm harry potter :)
11:27 <@gbjk> Apache/perl : There's a way, short of restarting apache between every change, of making sure that your module is reloaded every time during development. Can anyone remember it ?
11:27 <@muttley> so it's hard to tell what is possible and what is not
11:27 <@davorg> cue the Arthur C Clarke quote
11:28 <@muttley> I was mis-quoting it but yeah :)
11:28  * gbjk seems to remember Apache::Reload
11:28 <@richardc> gbjk: and what happens when you search for that?
11:29 <@davorg> richardc++ # starting off gently :)
11:29 <@gbjk> richardc: I'm looking at both a page on Apache::Reload and the search results of Apache perl module reload
11:29 <@DrHyde> davorg: i'd be more concerned that people think you might do something that unethical
11:29 <@gbjk> richardc: But I wanted to know if anyone else had any different / better methods
11:29 <@gbjk> davorg: Like a rollercoster, there's little accelleration time needed for richardc's animosity [sp?]
11:30 <@richardc> damnit, you found us out, we were keeping something more general and widely installed than Apache::Reload a secret
11:31 <@gbjk> richardc: How would I know without asking ?
11:31 <@richardc> that's fucked everything into a cocked hat, we'll never be able to be l33t again
11:32 <@richardc> I don't know, maybe by THINKING!
11:32 <@lathos> Us? Unethical? Never.

11:53 <@robin_sz> and how are my little mongers this morning?

11:54 <@davorg> don't know about your mongers, but this one is a bit tired to be honest.

11:56 <@aef> gbjk: Oops.
11:56 <@davorg> robin_sz: yep, that's me
11:56 <@robin_sz> gbjk: good plan, expect to get about 2.5k for it when you sell it ...

11:56 <@gbjk> robin_sz: Nah - should get about 12-15k when I sell it, but it'll take a while to find a buyer again

11:58 <@lathos> AMP got some publicity today.
11:58 <@aef> daveh: It's london.pm knitting week
11:58 <@davorg> gbjk: fsvo "better"
11:58 <@aef> lathos: Mmm? "AMP in deep shit"?
11:58 <@lathos> That's the one.

11:58 <@aef> And I didn't even have to read the news :)
11:58 <@lathos> http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3165835.stm
11:59 <@gbjk> davorg: cleaner, faster and fussier...
11:59 <@lathos> gbjk: Um, does findnodes return a listref or a list?
11:59 <@lathos> Or is it (spit, gargle) context-sensitive?
12:00 <@gbjk> lathos: this is the odd bit. I seem to remember it returns a blessed object
12:00 <@lathos> If it return a list, then ->[0] is definitely not better.
12:00 <@gbjk> Might return a blessed array, yes
12:00 <@lathos> If it returns a listref, then my ($var) = ... is pretty bad too.
12:01 <@gbjk> lathos: my ($var) with a listref works ?
12:01 <@lathos> Nope. Perl does not automagically dereference arrays.
12:01 <@lathos> Or anything, for that matter.
12:02 <@gbjk> lathos: I remember reading something about something being automatically dereferenced in perl ?
12:02 <@lathos> So in short, the better one is the one which actually works. If both appear to work, check which one *actually* works. If both actually work, your XML module is doing something horribly screwy.
12:02 <@gbjk> lathos: Completely different subject though.
12:02 <@lathos> You may remember that. However, it is not true.
12:02 <@gbjk> lathos: Okay.
12:02 <@lathos> Try "@a = [1,2];" if you don't believe me.
12:03 <@gbjk> lathos: I believe you. I must have been mistaken. I think the memory comes from the OO perl book, which might have been blended with other info and got confused
12:04 <@aef> gbjk: Well, you don't need ->s in multiple index lookups, like $foo[2]{three}[4] ... that kind of thing
12:04 <@aef> (Well, at most one ->)
12:04 <@lathos> Or maybe Damian was doing something horribly screwy at that point.
12:05 <@aef> lathos: Damian? Do something horribly screwy? Surely not...
12:05 <@lathos> "Fourteen people squeezed into a phone booth on Edinburgh's Royal Mile at 1300 BST on Tuesday."
12:06 <@aef> lathos: Someone dropped a pound coin? :L)
12:06 <@gbjk> lol
12:06 <@lathos> Sorry, I'm being presumptious. I'm sure that Damian, being a good teacher, would never use a teaching setting in order to show off his personal prowess.

12:30 <@gbjk> robin_sz: Boss is suggesting to me that foo could take you to court and demonstrate a right to that name...
12:30 <@Magnus> foo will prefer to settle out of court, shirley
12:30 <@Magnus> but then, they'll probably convince the judge that you should pay costs
12:30 <@Magnus> and quite rightly
12:31 <@robin_sz> gbjk: yeah right. your boss obviously has no clue about how these things work ...
12:31 <@gbjk> robin_sz: I'd like to agree with you... but he's very knowledgable about business law ...
12:31 <@Magnus> erm...
12:31 <@DrHyde> i have an objecty question.  i have two types of object, Foo and Bar, both of which inherit most of their methods from Object.  Object->new() takes one parameter and based on that, knows whether the user wants a Foo or a Bar.  So it in turn calls the constructor for Foo or Bar as appropriate, returning a Foo or a Bar object instead of an Object object.  Is this sensible?
12:32 <@Nicholas> presumably the least cost option to foocom is not to go to court
12:32 <@Magnus> robin_sz: such things do happen

13:11 <@muttley> I have this code
13:11 <@muttley> my $local = scalar localtime();
13:11 <@muttley> and when it's interpolated in the template
13:11 <@muttley> it comes out as
13:11 <@gellyfish> yeah I have seen that
13:11 <@muttley> Time::tm=ARRAY(0x9881a28)
13:11 <@muttley> the fuck?
13:11 <@lathos> Time to not use Time::tm.
13:11 <@lathos> Or use CORE::localtime() instead.
13:12 <@muttley> where does Time::tm come from? Never seen that before
13:13 <@lathos> Time::localtime and Time::gmtime. Core modules.

13:14 <@lathos> Mmm, bug in Pod::Coveraeg.
13:14 <@Magnus> anyone know a good anti-spam filter for Outlook/Outlook Express?
13:15 <@davorg> get your ISP to insall spamassassin
13:15 <@gellyfish> Magnus, disconnect the computer from the network
13:15 <@kane> magnus: do it serverside
13:15 <@kane> magnus: coincidentally, xs4all sells them
13:15 <@Magnus> serverside isn't an option in this case
13:15 <@Magnus> it might be in the future
13:16 <@muttley> Magnus: there's an Outlook version of Spamassassin I think
13:16 <@lathos> Or maybe it's in Pod::Find
13:16 <@gellyfish> make a pop3 proxy that does the spamassassin thing
13:16 <@Magnus> gellyfish: oooh that's a cool idea
13:16 <@lathos> Or maybe it's just in Mark Overmeer.

13:36 <@Kake> Hm, it's not actually that person's fault that they've mailed the list instead of Dave.  The archives munge From: headers so the list address is given as the poster's address.
13:37 <@richardc> alternative it is for not noticing that this happend to all messages
13:37 <@Kake> Is there a good thing I can go and read that will help me learn how to do a code review?
13:37 <@richardc> but no, it shouldn't really show an address
13:37 <@richardc> Kake: some bad code
13:38 <@lathos> Hooray. 3 Mail::Message bugs reported in 3 days.
13:39 <@richardc> first you fume about it,   then you get specific.  being specific you call code review
13:39 <@DrHyde> Kake: i vaguely remember seeing a sample review on securityfocus, although it was for C, not perl.
13:39 <@Kake> I don't think I'm going to be reviewing *bad* code.  I'm just wondering whether I'm competent to do this.  The person who wrote the code is at least as good a programmer as me, I think.
13:39 <@muttley> Kake: it kind of doesn't matter
13:39 <@muttley> even good programmers make mistakes
13:39 <@muttley> ...
13:39 <@davorg> Kake: that dosn't matter. the point is that you are a _different_ programmer :)
13:39 <@muttley> look at me for example
13:39  * Kake looks on securityfocus
13:39  * muttley ducks
13:40 <@lathos> The best way to learn how to do code reviews is to have lots of your code reviewed by a bloody good reviewer.
13:40 <@richardc> muttley: what happened, did you eat the real muttley?
13:40 <@Kake> lathos: I am being offered a review of my code as part-payment, which is part of my motivation for wanting to do this.  I keep desiring code review but nobody seems to want to do it for me.
13:41 <@muttley> richardc: with some fava beans and a nice chianti
13:41 <@hex> Ugh. Anyone use Mozilla? If so, what's the name of the bookmarks folder you put things in to appear on the toolbar?
13:41 <@Kake> I can offer baked or knitted goods in return.
13:41 <@lathos> OK, I really do need to set up a code review ladder.

13:41 <@Kake> Yes, you do.  Off you go.

13:45 <@hex> richardc: I can see the toolbar; however as my post to hates-software mentions, the fucking thing just deleted all my bookmarks. including the folder with toolbar stuff in it, which means it won't let me drag things onto the toolbar!

11:52 <@Kake> I can write SQL; that's not the problem.  
11:52 <@sky> my parents decided to open a half kilo can of beluga, yum

11:53 <@richardc> you got up?
11:53 <@Kake> Yeah, I knew that was a mistake.
11:54 <@sky> you running the latest DBI?
11:55 <@Kake> No - 1.21 - I'll try upgrading but I'm going by the docs.
11:55 <@richardc> it looks ok from here
11:56 <@sky> Kake: I recall seeing this exact bug a couple of days ago by tomi and pierre, they solved it by upgrading
11:56 <@kungfuftr> Kake-> are you using $dbh->quote() anywhere?
11:56 <@Kake> sky: cool, it's upgrading now
11:56 <@Kake> Nope, same problem.
11:57 <@Kake> kungfuftr: No.
11:57 <@richardc> goddamn. no wonder I didn't find this.  not only is it a magic number, it's the worng magic number
11:57 <@richardc> maybe I should check the code through for all numeric constants

12:00 <@richardc> oh, wait
12:00 <@richardc> argh!
12:02 <@DrHyde> stupid fscking windows "email" "admins" block attachment.tar.gz because "filenames with two dots are dangerous"

12:04 <@vorsprung> acme, different hashing schemes suit different data
12:05 <@kungfuftr> wtf!?!?! hth did my server come back up...
12:05  * aef copies from #perl...
12:05 <@aef> Any opinions on Apache::SubProcess? It seems to be something I should be using when forking in mod_perl; but it's a 0.03 version and no POD and not much in the way of test resutls on CPAN....
12:06 -!- grault is now known as hex
12:06 <@aef> seen sphyg
12:06 <@kungfuftr> very very odd... network inferface goes down after 3 days and sudden comes back up after 2 days...

12:06 <@richardc> don't use code without pod.  0.03 should be meaningless
12:07 <@aef> richardc: The first bit was what I was thinking.
12:09  * Kake looks ashamed.  I was scrutinising the wrong bit of code.  I have found the bug now.
12:09  * DrHyde sneaks his data through an encrypted channel to prevent the stupid firewall and stupid anti-virus software deployed by stupid people from deleting his work
12:09 <@DrHyde> <-- mildly peeved
12:10 <@aef> DrHyde: What AV? Something heuristic?
12:10 <@richardc> you missed out the stupid before work
12:11 <@DrHyde> aef: don't know, don't care, broken
12:11 <@aef> DrHyde: But presumably your work isn't a big database of viruses or anything?

12:13 <+pasty> "Kake" at 217.10.129.148 pasted "Mail::Send question" at http://paste.husk.org/40
12:13 <@aef> Our product likes to block double extensions too, but it allows ones like .tar.gz
12:13 -!- kungfuft1 is now known as kungfuftr
12:13 <@DrHyde> so imagine how dangerous a file with THREE dots in its name must be!
12:13 <@DrHyde> they refuse to whitelist .tar.gz
12:13 <@aef> That's nice of them.
12:14  * aef wonders if they're hiding the reality of "Whitelist? What's a whitelist?" behind a security argument.
12:14 <@DrHyde> they are doing everything in their power to convince me that people who choose to use windows require retroactive abortions
12:15 <@aef> Kake: Could your server be blocking it if it has a bad From address or something?
12:16 <@Kake> Oh yeah, a From address would help.  I know.  I'll try it from a machine where I can watch the exim logs rather than expecting people to blindly speculate.
12:17 <@richardc> but this is IRC, what else is it for if not blind speculation
12:17 <@aef> richardc: I have insufficient data to answer that.
