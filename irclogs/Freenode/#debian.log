11:49 < popnow> jm_: to change the uid it's just "chown 660 the_file"? if I read the man chown right?
11:49 -!- LarsSleep is now known as LarstiQ
11:49 < jm_> doug_ -- it has the supprot for it
11:49 < jm_> support
11:50 < jm_> popnow -- no, man chown
11:50 < doug_> So that's pretty much it ... no major code difference?
11:50 < Stoerte> keta: funny thing is Postfix is one of (if not the) the newbie friendlyest MTAs, qmail should be a pain.
11:50 < Trewas> doug_: phoenix (well firebird) does not have email-client and various other crap like mozilla, so it is somewhat smaller and faster
11:50 < rich_> doug_ I would not know. never tried phoenix
11:50 < jm_> doug_ -- they both use gecko, but the rest is completely different
11:50 < keta> popnow: no stop it, you'll screw you box, read first info file permissions
11:50 < Stoerte> most good software is easy IMO
11:51 < popnow> jm_: god, wrong again. then I don't get it.. "chown 660.660 the_file" don't understand the man chown...
11:51 < popnow> keta: that's the reason I ask before I do anything :-)
11:51 < doug_> is phoenix considered to be the most streamlined as far as its coding, maybe the fastest to render a page? benchmark stuff?
11:51 < jm_> popnow -- chown darijo file, is that so hard ?
11:51 < Stoerte> popnow: chown user:group

11:52 < buzzsaw> should i use the unofficial net install images or theofficial net install images?
11:52 < keta> Stoerte: I've been using qmail since one year, now I still have some troubles if I don't repeat an install that was my default, postfix is lovely, and is config is so clear for a ex-qmail-user that doesn't even need a lot of rtfm

11:54 < buzzsaw> ok
11:54 < PixyStyx> is it possible to get mozilla/phoenix to open up mutt when you click on a mailto: link?
11:54 < paladin> remember.. phoenix does not exist anymore ;) it is mozilla firebird now

11:57 < zinx> shaun22: yes
11:57 < Trewas> mozilla has name firebird already trademarked so I don't think they will be changing anywhere from that
11:57 < doug_> you mean "mozilla firebird" trademarked..

17:57 < chimun> madness1: yes... it is hard to just change over i guess
17:57 < bach2> the package wordtrans-kde seems tp depend on kdelibs3 that is obsolete
17:57 < madness1> chimun: but I certainly think that your argument that "PHP sux ass" is null and void.
17:57 < ppmbx> madness1: ah, well there are tons and tons of modules available for perl
17:57 < bach2> chimun: that didn't work
17:57 < madness1> chimun: "I don't like PHP because ...." would have been a more valid argument, perhaps :P

I already did this:  To upgrade an ext2 partition to ext3 simply involves adding a journal.  'tune2fs -O +has_journal /dev/hda1' (where hda1 is the partition you want to change to ext3).  Don't forget to change /etc/fstab to specify ext3 for the partition.

16:37 < spacecat> ok, I'm installing debian, but it doesn't recognize my on-board 3com gigabit nic ...
16:37 < pfote> beta3: whats the advantage of grub ? never tried that one ..
16:37 -!- lewnidas_ [~lewnidas@212.205.215.109] has quit []
16:37 < fhffhqvb> pfote: the big advantage is that you get to troll about using grub and how people still using lilo are dumbasses etc etc.
16:37 < manchine> in which file can i change my preferred desktop environment?
16:37 < spacecat> the driver from Asus says you have to do a makefile that results in a file called 3c2000.o ...
16:37 < beta3> asg: you may consider add ing the woody ones manually

16:38 < fairway> that still doesnt work
16:38 < asg> beta3: :) I'll have a go later on.
16:38 < asg> fairway: same issue?
16:38 < manchine> besides, how can i enable my soundboard?
16:38 < fairway> how could I check if exim is working?
16:38 < spacecat> well, add a 0 to that -- could I use this then on the "install drivers" page?
16:38 < fairway> asg: yes
16:38 < asg> fairway: netstat
16:38 < fairway> I mean running
16:38 < fhffhqvb> ~tell manchine about sound

16:39 < spacecat> does anyone know this site debian.easter-eggs.org?  is it just easter eggs, or might this be the driver file I'm looking for?

16:42 < asg> fairway: well, you can either start inetd (/etc/init.d/inetd or comment it out of there and use /etc/init.d/exim)
16:42 < asg> fhffhqvb: that sounds like a lot, ets.

16:43 < steve-shaw> I'm running wget to download onto an external usb hdd with vfat filesystem. The wget program is hanging as it continues. kill and kill -9 have no effect. I tried to truncate the last few bytes of the file with a Ruby script but that process hung too. Any ideas?
16:43 < beta3> asg: working on some real cool scripts to make grub-menu-floppy images, and floppies
16:43 < asg> fhffhqvb: portsentry
16:43 < fhffhqvb> steve-shaw: huh?
16:43 < asg> beta3: cool!
16:43 < Sinistrad> How, in gnome, do I stop a process from displaying in the taskbar (i.e.: I have xmms-status-plugin, so I don't want to see xmms in the gnome taskbar)
16:44 < asg> fhffhqvb: you could also just use tcpdump and filter on incoming port 53
16:44 < Sinistrad> gnome/metacity
16:44 < pfote> fhffhqvb: put in a little script in inetd that dumps everything incoming to a file and then inspect it
16:44 < pfote> or like asg said
16:44 < fairway> asg: this is really weird it still doesnt show up in netstat after I run inetd

16:45 < asg> fairway: what happens if you type '/usr/sbin/exim -bt test@test.com' ?
16:45 < beta3> asg: to make the images, I figured out a way to make a empty filesystem over loopback
16:45 < asg> fhffhqvb: I thought it had a way to log what was coming in but I could be wrong
