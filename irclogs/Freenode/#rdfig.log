14:21 < hendry> libby: What about a unix tool? like getting date to switch to EST ... (?)
14:22 < libby> sorry, not sure what you mean hendry....
14:22 < dajobe> TZ=EST date
14:22 < dajobe> that works from most unix prompts
14:25 < hendry> dajobe: then you have to reset it back. k
14:26  * hendry tries out PhotoSMORE
14:26 < dajobe> it doesn't change the timezone, just displays the date in the zone you give
14:29 < hendry> dajobe: oh sorry. didn't run them together. I exported. Oops. Cheers
14:30 < hendry> With PhotoSMORE, can you annotate images? Can only seem to do Image manip tasks
14:32 < hendry> I think you can. According to this : http://www.mindswap.org/~aditkal/photoSMORE.jpg
14:32 < hendry> But the UI sucks bad.
14:38 < libby> blimey that looks familiar :)

15:04 < GregElin> Is  that Kai?
15:04 < GregElin> Hey, Kai. Glad you could make it.
15:06 < hendry> I wish the tool my group are working on was presentable at this time. 
15:06 < GregElin> hi libby
15:08 < GregElin> Kai, can you describe it? Do you think it might be ready by 8.27?
15:11 < hendry> GregElin: Should be ready then. 
15:11 < darobin> has anyone done work bridging XForms and RDF?
15:12 < hendry> It
15:12 < hendry> Sorry, it's similar to RDFPIC for simplicity. But it sports a tree view and selection tools
15:12 < libby> darobin, charles mcCathieNville has been doing some stuff generating RDF using xforms
15:12 < darobin> anything available online?
15:12 < hendry> There are SE docs here : http://db.cs.helsinki.fi/~msisalmi/twiki/bin/view/Digimon/DocumentCollection
15:13 < darobin> I was thinking that replacing XForms' constant use of XPath with some rdf ql might do most of the trick
15:13 < darobin> (emphasis on might)
15:14 < libby> interesting
15:14 < libby> I was wittering about somethign similar for xslt recently
15:14 < libby> I do;t think char;es' stuff does anything like that tho

15:16 < darobin> google finds something about using xforms as an intermediate step between rdfs and rdf authoring, but it has no details

15:17 < darobin> Wack: any details?
15:17 < Wack> well, theoretically xforms; it only works with vanilla html forms now
15:18 < GregElin> brb
15:18 < Wack> but i've used xforms controls etc to augment rdfs schemas in order to help generating the html
15:18 -!- GregElin [~gregelin@nycmny1-ar7-4-3-085-101.nycmny1.elnk.dsl.genuity.net] has quit ["Bye!"]
15:19 < Wack> it's a module in our website development framework
15:19 -!- ygonno [~chatzilla@ZC138196.ppp.dion.ne.jp] has joined #rdfig
15:19 < Wack> all data storage and in-request data is in an rdf model
15:19 < darobin> libby: thanks for the pointer. It seems quite specific to EARL, but appears to have some interesting stuff
15:20 < darobin> Wack: so given some rdf it generates the HTML interface to edit it?
15:20 < Wack> so it was only a matter of time to bridge rdfs and a form generating/validating/processing module
15:20 < Wack> that's the plan, yes
15:20 < darobin> very interesting
15:20 -!- GregElin [~gregelin@nycmny1-ar7-4-3-085-101.nycmny1.elnk.dsl.genuity.net] has joined #rdfig
15:20 < Wack> although it currently is dependent on the 'hints' you give it
15:20 < GregElin> Back!
15:21 -!- DanC_jam [~connolly@dhcp9570110.columbus.rr.com] has quit [Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)]
15:21 < darobin> well you almost always need a little hinting
15:21 -!- verbosus [~verbosus@ppp-86-42.98-62.inwind.it] has quit [Read error: 113 (No route to host)]
15:21 < darobin> to begin with, if a datatype <-> widgets that worked in all cases existed, we'd know about it :)
15:22 < Wack> and it's limited to creating statements with literals as objects (unless you point to choices which can be any other (anonymous or not) resource in the model)
15:22 < libby> darobin, I think there's another url for chaals' work, but ccan't fnd it
15:22 < darobin> libby: thanks a lot, nevermind, I'll pester him when he turns up ;)
15:23 < Wack> and the subject is always a resource representing the form "instance", so creating a host of instances of different rdfs classes is not possible yet
15:23 < darobin> Wack: ok, those limitations seem fairly normal for work in progress, they should be liftable
15:24 < Wack> I can put up the schema-schema i've created that should describe the idea more or less?
15:25 < darobin> I'm thinking along the lines of if you replace XPath with an rdfql you can access the instance in a way that makes sense, and from there all the bidirectional events stuff should work
15:25 < darobin> (perhaps with some rough bits around the edge)
15:25 < darobin> Wack: sure, that'd be great
15:25 < GregElin> Oy...so many acronyms. Is there an existing list anyway?
15:26  * darobin wishes he was paid to do research on anything he pleases whenever he pleases
15:27 < libby> very interesting idea darobin. seems to be lots of general interest about the relationship between graphs and tree and rdf and xml tools like that at the moment...
15:27 < darobin> yes
15:28 < darobin> and I suspect a number of tools made to work on trees, like xforms, work only on trees because people haven't thought of making them work elsewhere
15:28 < darobin> XForms needs trees on the UI side, because the event model is pretty heavily tied to trees
15:28 < libby> I agree
15:28 < libby> re graph/tree thing
15:28 < darobin> but I don't see why it needs it on the instance and model
15:29 < darobin> (and UIs as trees tends to make sense anyway)
15:29 < libby> so mizlla has xul, a thing for graph->tree transfrmation, mostly for UI stuff I think
15:29 < libby> s/mizilla/mozilla/
15:29 < darobin> yes
15:29 < darobin> mizilla is a cute name :)
15:29 < libby> though I've never got any demos working right
15:29 < libby> heh
15:30 < darobin> they seem to work for me. at least, my mozilla works and a number of the UI bits come from RDF (eg the mailbox tree)
15:30 < darobin> I think there's a paper on the moz site explaining that they have no general purpose graph2tree facility though
15:30  * darobin digs
15:31 < libby> yeah, I meant, there are some demos (I think made by danbri) using the Mooz stuff ith different sorts of data. bt they're fiddly to debug
15:31 < libby> s/mooz/moz/
15:31 < libby> important stuff is there though: a QL (with optionsals) and a templating language
15:32 < darobin> yup
15:32 < darobin> from http://www.mozilla.org/rdf/doc/xul-template-reference.html footnote 1 [[ Originally, we thought that it would be possibly to have a generic "graph-to-content" translation algorithm that, when combined with CSS2, could produce any appropriate content model (see this document). It quickly became clear that this was not the case ]]

15:34 -!- maxf [~mf@accueil.w3.org] has joined #rdfig
15:34 < darobin> libby: do I mean which part?
15:35 < GregElin> (stepping away)
15:36 < libby> I think I'm on the wrong tack darbin: I was thinkingof generic graph to tree queries, since RDF queries are often like graphs
15:37 < libby> anyway...
15:37 < darobin> oh
15:38 < darobin> you mean turning a query that's like a graph into a query that's like a tree?
15:38 < libby> I think I'm just thinking twistedly
15:38 < libby> yeah
15:38 < libby> I was wondering what % of RDFgraphs can be expressed as trees
15:38 < darobin> I hadn't thought of that :)
15:38 < libby> sorry, I mean, what % of RDF queries can be expressed as trees
15:39 < darobin> what makes rdf q more graphlike?
15:39 < libby> if many could be, then a tree-like syntax for rdf queries might be useful. if you see what I mean
15:40 < darobin> tree-like as in XPath-like?
15:40 -!- mortenf [~mortenf@213.170.235.168] has joined #rdfig
15:40 < libby> it tends to be, just because rdf people think of graphs and think of queries as graphs with muissing parts. or many do
15:40 < libby> yep
15:40 < darobin> ah yes, then I see what you mean
15:40  * darobin 's brain falls into place
15:41 < libby> I'm not being terribly clear today :)

15:43 -!- irc is now known as DanC-AIM_
15:43 < darobin> I see the interest in the approach of having a query that's a graph with missing bits, so you dip in in the graph you're querying and the interesting bits stick to it
15:43 < edd> nice imagery
15:44 < darobin> but is it still interesting to have more "stupid" queries?
15:44 < DanC-AIM_> This nickname is reserved???
15:44 < darobin> ie just get a boring set of triples back, à la sql?
15:44 < libby> heh, cute, darobin
15:44 < darobin> :)
15:44 < libby> like fluff
15:44 < sbp> -NickServ- The nickname [DanC-AIM_] is not registered
15:44 < libby> boring?
15:44 < edd> a set of triples is a graph..
15:45 < darobin> well, more "usual" :)
15:45 < GregElin> back
15:45 < Wack> darobin: http://www.angelite.nl/2003/05/22-form-schema.rdf (I had to change dns etc, so it took some time before it was available ;)
15:45 < libby> usual queries='sticky' queries?
15:46 < darobin> edd: yup, I'm being unclear, I guess what I meant is is it still interesting to see them flatly, as a list of individual triples, as if at that point they weren't interlinked
15:46 < darobin> this would facilitate the tree view
15:46 < darobin> libby: no, more like "mundane", or "pedestrian"
15:46  * darobin doesn't like RDBMS ;)
15:46 -!- Agony [engelh@mint.rz.fhtw-berlin.de] has joined #rdfig

15:47 < darobin> and probably not making much more sense than my usual braindump :)
15:48 < libby> why does a list of triples make it more tree-like?
15:48 < darobin> Wack: 404 :(
15:48 < DanC-AIM_> I wonder if norm knows about the image mtg
15:48 < DanC-AIM_> And gerald
15:48 < darobin> well it's the silliest tree, the root is the list, each triple is a branch with its own data as leaves
15:48 < darobin> (probably too boring)
15:49 < libby> ah, I get you
15:49 < libby> woudl that be useful?

15:50 < libby> on rdf-interest, geo list, chump twice and wiki... DanC-AIM_
15:50 < darobin> I guess a better way of making a ql look treelike would be to have sth like xpath each step of which is just graph traversal
15:51 < darobin> which is the case in xpath, except it's only in tree directions
15:51 < libby> that's the way I was thinking
15:51 < sbp> Wack: glad to see that you've used xml:base in there
15:51 < libby> I was wondering if xpath sntax would work for garphs
15:51 < darobin> so it's a sequence of moveTo commands

16:08 < novaspivack> Was up drinking with my brother and old friends last night.......
16:08 < verbosus> marccanter: I know Paolo as well (I'm from Italy).
16:08 < Bert> (I copied that "D:" at the start, or was that a typo?)
16:08 < novaspivack> this is WAY too early for me
16:08 < marccanter> Andiamo!
16:08 < GregElin> Nova...glad you made it!

16:09 <@danbri> OK, I see nine folks signed up, and plenty more lurkers. 
16:09 < novaspivack> marc: Ouch! Now That's dedication
16:09 < Ecyrd> Good evening.

16:09 -dc_rdfig:#rdfig- Added comment D17.
16:10 <@danbri> So, context for this gathering: various of us have been doing image description using (mostly) RDF/XML metadata, as well as toolbuilding, standards work etc.
16:10 < marccanter> Pete's in de house!
16:10 < novaspivack> I have a feeling our ubercoder Jim Wissner will not be awake for this as he codes all night usually
16:10 <@danbri> This is a *huge* subject area, so for today's gathering we've tried to bite off a more manageable piece.
16:10  * dino back
16:10 <@danbri> There was a thread on www-rdf-interest noting that we now have several different schemas for representing Exif metadata in RDF.
16:10 < shellac> D: attending
16:10 -dc_rdfig:#rdfig- Added comment D18.
16:11 < mortenf> see pointer to that thread in D3
16:11 <@danbri> Dino was also telling me about some plans from the SVG (w3c vector graphics) group re exposing Exif metadata...
16:11 < mortenf> erh, D4
16:11 < dino> technique wouldn't be limited to SVG - just an interface to image metadata
16:11 < GregElin> (I should mention this is the first of two conversations planned on image data and metadata. Today we are trying to get all caught up on EXIF and RDF, two more established trends...)
16:12 <@danbri> We don't have a particularly rigid agenda as a lot depends on the interests of who turned up, but my hope is we can make some progress towards converging on a common representation of Exif in RDF/XML, and understand that in the wider picture of image metadata.
16:12 < libby> image metadata in an image dino?
16:12  * danbri nods re Greg's point; several of us agreed also to meet up next week see http://esw.w3.org/topic/ImageDescription,
16:12 < dino> yep. could be anything, not just EXIF.
16:12 <@danbri> OK, so to tighten up agenda, does anyone want to bid for a specific agenda slot.
16:13 <@danbri> I'd like to hear from dean (dino) about SVG's plans...
16:13 <@danbri> Who else here has worked on a specific Exif/RDF representation? 
16:13 < mortenf> i'd like to ask karl if he has any specific plans re a unified exif schema?
16:13 < libby> next meet is in 2 weeks by the way....http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=27&month=8&year=2003&hour=14&min=30&sec=0&p1=0
16:13 < pete> can i suggest audio back channel at +1-702-851-4040, passcode 73344 ("rdfig")? 
16:14 <@danbri> Pete, that's a little expensive for non-americans... though thanks for the offer
16:14 < GregElin> I'd like a quick overview of where EXIF stands and is going.
16:14 < pete> optional, of course
16:14 < dino> I'd like some background on existing EXIF/RDF representations

16:16 <@danbri> Karl, I suspect we'll run into more questions than answers today, so I'm looking to collection questions/issues and have folk volunteer to go away and try to progress them. Does that make sense?
16:16 < mortenf> i've been playing around with exif, created a [http://www.wasab.dk/morten/2003/07/sempex/|Perl script] that emits rdf, using the schema at http://www.kanzaki.com/ns/exif (and Image::Info, RDF::Redland)
16:16 < verbosus> karl, danbri: is it possible to have someone from the EXIF wg for next scheduled chat?
16:17 < karlcow> yes danbri. Complete sense. I propose you are the chair and open and close the agenda item.
16:17 <@danbri> that would make sense. I sorta wanted to get our own house in order a bit and look into state of what we have...
16:17 <@danbri> Current RDF schemas for Exif include: Kanzaki's, Gerald's, Karl's, TimBL's, Norm's ...
16:18 <@danbri> I have one too, but it was a nasty hack.
16:18 <@danbri> OK, given the time in Australia, I propose we hear from Dean first; meanwhile folks can multi-task and take a look at the schemas in http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-interest/2003Aug/0021.html while listening attentively to Dean  
16:18 < dino> which is the least nasty? :)
16:18 < dino> thanks! :)
16:19 <@danbri> Dean, good question! Let's have a beauty contest later in the chat.
16:19 <@danbri> Dean, 10 mins on SVG incl questions?
16:19 <@danbri> logger, pointer?
16:19 < logger> See http://ilrt.org/discovery/chatlogs/rdfig/2003-08-13#T13-19-22
16:19 < dino> ok, you don't need to know anything about SVG here, apart from the fact that it is a client side technology that does lots of stuff with images.
16:19 < skimpIzu> why does man imagemagick not show exif
16:19 < dino> and as well all know, many images nowadays are dig photos.
16:19 < JibberJim> [off] HI, Sorry I'm late
16:20 -!- caz_ [cmcvm@dhcp-09.ilrt.bris.ac.uk] has joined #rdfig
16:20 < dino> also, most people use SVG in a scripting environment
16:20 <@danbri> D:[http://ilrt.org/discovery/chatlogs/rdfig/2003-08-13#T13-19-22|SVG + image metadata] (Dean)
16:20 -dc_rdfig:#rdfig- Added comment D20.
16:20 < dino> so lots of programmers want access to image metadata (EXIF is only a part of that)
16:20 < maxf> [off] (folks, try and get Dino to stay another 40 minutes and you'll be able to wish him a happy birthday ;)
16:20 -!- caz [cmcvm@dhcp-09.ilrt.bris.ac.uk] has quit [Connection reset by peer]
16:21 < dino> [off] thanks max
16:21 < verbosus> TimBL schema is 404: http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/pim/exif#
16:21 < dino> anyway, lots of people have asked for a standard way to get to the metadata of an included image
16:21 <@danbri> timbl-- #f'shame
16:21 < dino> and the SVG working group are happy to take it on
16:22 <@danbri> dean, OK cool. So the XML DOM (or SVG DOM) is expected way of interacting with this?
16:22 < dino> (we have lots of imaging companies there - Canon, Kodak, etc)
16:22 < skimpIzu> why does man imagemagick not show exif
16:22 < dino> well, my current feeling is that it should be exposed as an XML DOM
16:22 < dino> just for consistency
16:22 < dino> since other images in SVG will be exposed that way
16:23 <@danbri> More on SVG for those without google: http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/Overview.htm8
16:23 <@danbri> Can you briefly explain 'XML DOM' vs 'SVG DOM'?
16:23 < dino> however, we could also define a DOM interface that allows get() on EXIF stuff
16:23 < verbosus> skimpIzu: AFAIK imagemagik doesn't grok EXIF at all. It can preserve it while operating on an image, but it can't read/manipulate it.
16:23 < dino> XML DOM is defined for all XML grammars
16:23 < dino> SVG has an XML DOM
16:24 < dino> and also an extended DOM, kind of a generic graphics API 
16:24 -!- novaspivack [~nova@user-0cdf91r.cable.mindspring.com] has left #rdfig []
16:24 <@danbri> This is interesting as not clear how generic you'll want to make this. Exposing Exif would be awesome, but could we also expect to access metadata about the _content_ of the image? (like <foaf:depicts><wordnet:Cat foaf:name="Tom"/></foaf:depicts>)...
16:24 < dino> just does the graphics stuff
16:24 <@danbri> ...the latter seems much more ambitious
16:24 -!- novaspivack [~nova@user-0cdf91r.cable.mindspring.com] has joined #rdfig
16:24 < dino> yes, definitely
16:24 -!- novaspivack [~nova@user-0cdf91r.cable.mindspring.com] has quit []
16:24 -!- darobin [~robin@APastourelles-107-2-4-204.w193-252.abo.wanadoo.fr] has quit [Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)]
16:24 < dino> like I said, EXIF really isn't all that common a request
16:24 -!- novaspivack [~nova@user-0cdf91r.cable.mindspring.com] has joined #rdfig
16:24 < dino> many other image formats have more useful metadata 
16:25 < dino> medical images, aerial photos with geo references, etc
16:25 <@danbri> ...since describing the content of an image is a very underconstrained task; "describing stuff that is in a picture" isn't interestingly more constrained than "describing stuff", ie. arbitrary properties are pertinent.
16:25 < libby> interesting....
16:25 < dino> if anyone (Jim) wants to give an opinion please do
16:25 < Bert> In fact, why not a Web DOM instead of a XML DOM? JPEG is not XML but has metadata, too
16:26 < dino> now, the way w3c works usually is some fool (ie SVG) takes this on, and hopefully everyone else reviews and then uses
16:26 <@danbri> So, if the SVG WG do this properly (imho), they'll in effect have a slot where we could have a simple RDF API for scripters? Since much image metadata work is done at the RDF level...
16:26 < karlcow> It's why IPTC, NEWSML, RDFPIC etc have format for describing images
16:26 < dino> it wouldn't be specific to SVG of course
16:26 -!- novaspivack [~nova@user-0cdf91r.cable.mindspring.com] has left #rdfig []
16:26 < GregElin> what do you mean, Dan
16:26 < JibberJim> Hi, I'd be happy I think just with a get("EXIFNAME")  as it's all read only data, we're not going to update it or anything.
16:26 < karlcow> EXIF is good on the technical part.
16:26 < dino> imo, exif doesn't give you much interesting stuff.
16:27 < verbosus> JibberJim: one may want to edit the UserComments field.
16:27 < dino> at least, not much that you'd really want on the client
16:27 <@danbri> EXIF is sorta boring but essential, and I undestand people are stuffing geo info in there now, so it is increasingly interesting.
16:27 < JibberJim> A full XML vocab isn't necessary for just read only, (we could edit it, but how would we save it?)
16:27 <@danbri> My only use for Exif to date has been auto-rotating pictures from my (sadly lost) Canon. 
16:27 <@danbri> Ah yep, good question. Read-only makes things simpler.
16:28 < Bert> Readonly: hmm, but a std way to do read/write would be nice, too. I could use somebody else's library.
16:28 < dino> maybe Bert could speak up about the EXIF orientation bit, but there were plans for that to be honoured natively.
16:28 < karlcow> EXIF will be interesting for technical profession, people who keeps records of the parameters of the image, speed, etc... like astrophysicists for example. 
16:28 < verbosus> danbri: one may also want to edit the last modified date of a picture
16:28 <@danbri> So Dean, given time constraints today, how can imagey folks and rdfy folks and RDF/imagey folks track, participate etc... 
16:28 <@danbri> ?
16:28 < karlcow> Another format for description is interesting too (IPTC like or more complete)
16:28 < JibberJim> As long as height/width is also honoured natively!
16:28 < dino> umm.. good question.
16:28 < _joshua> Hi
16:28 < dino> i guess there will be something in SVG 1.2 drafts soon
16:29 <@danbri> I'd love to see a requirements doc from SVG WG that we could review... 
16:29 < dino> but if there is enough interest, then we could split it out as a note or something.
16:29 < dino> remove it from SVG.
16:29 < libby> hi _joshua
16:29 < _joshua> What'd I miss?
16:29 < dino> the good thing is that we have a few people that are really into this stuff.
16:29 <@danbri> _joshua, see logs linked from rdfig.xmlhack.com
16:29 < libby> dino is telling us about images and svg and exif
16:29 < dino> Canon and Kodak obviously
16:29 < hendry> GregElin: I need to be off. I don't think I can contribute to any EXIF issues besides. So perhaps later this month!
16:29 < dino> but also Adobe
16:29 < karlcow> dino, I think it might give it more publicity and make it possible for people to reuse it.
16:29  * danbri nods
16:29 < mortenf> _joshua, see logs: http://ilrt.org/discovery/chatlogs/rdfig/2003-08-13.html
16:30 <@danbri> ok hendry, thanks for coming
16:30 < dino> The Adobe SVG team are the same team that developed Photoshop ALbum
16:30 < _joshua> Gotcha.
16:30 < JibberJim> EXIF is I think relatively simple and whilst essential is not that useful, XMP is more exciting.
16:30 < dino> so they know exif quite well.
16:30 < libby> more general image description stuff next time hendry
16:30 < dino> however, they will tell you that there is a lot of variation in the EXIF spewed out by today's cameras
16:30 <@danbri> Dino, are you convinced that image metadata problems shade into general descrition issues: if you're describing a picture of a Sheep called 'Dolly', you should be using the same markup as someone who is describing a Sheep called 'Dolly'...
16:30 < verbosus> JibberJim: yes, but how many digicams use XMP now?
16:30  * danbri notes we're over 10 mins on this
16:31 < _joshua> I have a dumb question: is it more interesting to extract EXIF data and represent it outside the image files, or is it more interesting to keep metadata in the file itself?
16:31 <@danbri> Ah, glad you mentioned XMP.
16:31 < Bert> (EXIF Orientation field is a bit of a problem in practice, since it is hard to predict which software honours it and which doesn't. The people making photo printers have tried to resolve that with CSS, but that doesn't really improve it.)
16:31 < JibberJim> IS EXIF an evolving standard, can people add new fields to it?
16:31 < dino> i'll shut up now!
16:31 <@danbri> XMP is Adobe's metadata framework thing.
16:31 < dino> EXIF is evolving
16:31 < _joshua> Also, what about TIFF metadata (GeoTIFF, etc)
16:31 <@danbri> Dean, do you have any sense for how XMP is connected (or not) to the SVG work within Adobe? 
16:31 < _joshua> I thought EXIF is key->value
16:31 < dino> actually EXIF is just TIFF metadata if I'm not mistaken
16:32 < dino> XMP and SVG are not too related within Adovbe
16:32 < _joshua> Gotcha
16:32 < dino> apart from the Illustrator team embedding XMP in SVG export.
16:32 <@danbri> Is there someone here who could offer a polite but critiquing commentary on the schemas listed in http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-interest/2003Aug/0021.html ?
16:32 < JibberJim> I thought so to, but that means trying to specify an XML DOM that's not a get(" ") is likely to not be too easy.
16:32 -!- bijan [~chatzilla@gandalf.mindlab.umd.edu] has joined #rdfig
16:32 < _joshua> I still like (was it Jim's idea?) of embedding SVG in EXIF
16:33 <@danbri> dino, thanks for the SVG update. Having script access to this would be awesome. Let's try to make sure RDFIG & co review the next drafts...
16:33 < dino> another thing we're looking into is accessing embedded copyright info in images.
16:33 < karlcow> JibberJim EXIF, is a binary format. key -> value for images. The specs are evolving :) and progress, new elements are added. http://www.exif.org/
16:33 <@danbri> D:See also [http://www.exif.org/|Exif website].
16:33 -dc_rdfig:#rdfig- Added comment D21.
16:33 < karlcow> danbri, on the list of proposed schema only two are really usable now :)
16:34 < verbosus> danbri, about the schemas
16:34 <@danbri> which ones? :)
16:34 < verbosus> TimBL is 404
16:34 < karlcow> Th one from Norman Walsh
16:34 <@danbri> are we done with SVG? Any probing questions for Dean?
16:34 < karlcow> The one from kanzaki.
16:34 <@danbri> ----
16:34 < verbosus> Gerald and Karl do not seem proper RDF schemas, actually.
16:34 < GregElin> what is the timeline for SVG?
16:34  * dino moves to lurker mode.
16:34 < verbosus> So the options are either nwalsh's one, or kanzaki's one.
16:34 <@danbri> thanks Dean! :)
16:35 < karlcow> The problem of the kanzaki one is that youhave a lot of kanjis in it ;)
16:35 < JibberJim> Has to be by March for 1.2 GregElin
16:35 <@danbri> (for coming, not lurking)
16:35 < verbosus> karlcow: yup. Do you know any japanese? :-)
16:35 < GregElin> what aare the details for 1.2 - what does it include (or where is the link)?
16:35 < dino> has anyone heard of DIG35
16:35 < dino> ?
16:35 <@danbri> Kanzaki's done some really nice work on RDF stuff, docs etc.
16:35 < dino> that's the most official image metadata thing I know of
16:35 <@danbri> I don't know much about DIG35, it rings a bell, that's all.
16:35 < karlcow> For mine, I was starting to make one, but I have stopped when I have discovered that other people were doing it. and so decided to try to start a common effort on it.
16:36 < karlcow> More effective that way.
16:36 <@danbri> logger, pointer?
16:36 < logger> See http://ilrt.org/discovery/chatlogs/rdfig/2003-08-13#T13-36-03
16:36 < dino> and also specifies how to embed EXIF as XML
16:36 < verbosus> In kanzaki's one he wrote some descriptions in japanese.
16:36 < karlcow> So if we could define a common format it would be very nice.
16:36 <@danbri> D:Exif RDFS beauty contest [http://ilrt.org/discovery/chatlogs/rdfig/2003-08-13#T13-36-03|compare and contrast].
16:36 -dc_rdfig:#rdfig- Added comment D22.
16:36 < _joshua> Another metadata standard?
16:36 < verbosus> But I reckon it could be easy to translate them and ask him to add them to his schema.
16:36 < karlcow> [off] verbosus: yes I know a few kanjis but not enough
16:36  * dino looks for DIG35 info - but from memory it is a private consortium (like W3C)
16:36 <@danbri> So, TimBl's 404s. Kanzaki's looks good. DIG's EXIF-in-XML needs looking at.
16:37 < _joshua> dig35 is http://www.i3a.org/i_dig35.html and appears to be a for-pay standard!
16:37 <@danbri> Gerald's? Any issues there?
16:37 < karlcow> As I said at the start, EXIF is not enough, EXIF is one of the brick of a meta Image description format
16:37 < mortenf> it seems nwalsh's is a subset of kanzaki's, except for tag ids
16:37 < _joshua> who is i3a?
16:37 < GregElin> Right, karlcow. 
16:37 < dino> I also remember a sourceforge project for DIG35 stuff
16:37 < karlcow> but we could come with small schemas for format like EXIF and others and combine them when needed.
16:38 < verbosus> Yeah mortenf. How about integrating nwalsh's descriptions into kanzaki?
16:38 < mortenf> yep, starting with exif sounds reasonable, then move
16:38 <@danbri> OK, yes... so there are two reasons why DIG doesn't appeal to me. Pay for (if that's the case); also being XML but not RDF, we can't easily mix it with other image metadata.
16:38 < mortenf> good idea, how would ge go about that?
16:38 < karlcow> So I guess if we start a new format we will have to have kanzaki participating and Norman Walsh
16:38 < dino> http://picturemetadata.sourceforge.net/
16:38 -dc_rdfig:#rdfig- E: http://picturemetadata.sourceforge.net/ from dino
16:38 <@danbri> So is main issue with Kanzaki's purely that of getting more english documentation?
16:38 <@danbri> He does show up here or in #foaf sometimes, btw.
16:38 < _joshua> there's hardly any material on the web about dig35
16:38 < karlcow> Norman Walsh has already proposed to implement any format we will come with
16:38 < dino> [off] oops, can't remember chump commands
16:39 < verbosus> danbri, can we validate his schema before starting to use it?
16:39 < dino> E| C++ library for DIG35
16:39 < mortenf> even if it has japanese descriptions, it still has some english in there
16:39 < dajobe> [off] use E:|Title
16:39 <@danbri> verbosus, which sense of validate?
16:39 < GregElin> But does EXIF provider the means to easily carry data across cameras,etc?
16:39 < dino> E:| C++ library for DIG35
16:39 -dc_rdfig:#rdfig- Titled item E.
16:39 <@danbri> Kanzaki's looks like a good start.
16:39 < verbosus> danbri: see if it is well-formed RDFS.
16:40 < karlcow> danbri: I can work with kanzaki to make an english version of its schema, and so we could discuss if people identify issues.
16:40 < verbosus> GregElin: that's a big problem. With the common python libraries out there I can't extract some EXIF from my Canon.
16:40 <@danbri> An attempt to load the RDF from URI 'http://www.kanzaki.com/ns/exif' failed. (Cannot open stream.)
16:40 <@danbri> ---tried RDF validator on it. strange.
16:40 <@danbri> karl, that's excellent.
16:40 < mortenf> karlcow, that sounds great; what about the "issues" you listed before?
16:40 -!- shellac [~pldms@2001:618:400:3946:230:65ff:feb0:c95e] has quit [Read error: 54 (Connection reset by peer)]
16:41 < verbosus> karlcow: good!
16:41 <@danbri> OK, any objections to proceeding with that? Sounds like Kanzaki's version won the beauty contest...
16:41 < dino> [off] I might have a copy of the DIG35 format if anyone wants to see it. (says me, hoping [off] really means off)
16:41 < marccanter> who invented/created EXIF?
16:41 < karlcow> marccanter: EXIF is the result of a camera industry consortium
16:41 < karlcow> mostly japanese
16:41 <@danbri> Karl, can you take an action to review Kanzaki's schema, check it validates, and add English translations where needed?
16:41 < marccanter> I assume they're not clued into RDF?
16:41 < dino> EXIF is not as portable amongst cameras as you would think
16:41 <@danbri> (I can help w/ the translation)
16:41 < karlcow> Yes :) danbri
16:42 < dino> the Adobe PS Album team complained about this
16:42 < verbosus> dino: yeah, that's a big problem.
16:42 < JibberJim> Anything with Kanji in is normally more beautiful than English letters....
16:42 < verbosus> dino: that's why I suggested having EXIF people in the meeting.
16:42 <@danbri> ACTION: Karl to review Kanzaki's schema, check it validates, and (w/ danbri) help w/ any English translations needed
16:42 -dc_rdfig:#rdfig- Label ACTION not found.
16:42 < dino> not everyone uses the same field for the same thing, sometimes they don't use the correct value, etc.
16:42 < pete> marc: JEIDA ( Japan Electronic Industry Development Association ). 
16:42 < verbosus> dino: maybe you could point this problem to the Canon/Kodak people you know.
16:42 < dino> normally, each manufacture only goes as far as testing in their own photo software
16:43 < _joshua> someone at adobe griping about tiff and exif: http://remotesensing.org/lists/libtiff_archive/msg01769.html
16:43 < mortenf> hmm, perhaps we should do a (small) survey of field usage per manufacturer?
16:43 < karlcow> :) Interoperability problem and people not respecting specs... hmm bizarre ;)
16:43 < pete> here's a summary page summarizing lots of these image metadata standards: http://peccatte.karefil.com/Software/Metadata.htm (in French, though, sorry)
16:43 <@danbri> I'd like to offer to Kanzaki that we host his version of the namespace at a www.w3.org URI, since we can provide long-lived uris... Does that seem a useful thing to do?
16:44 < mortenf> indeed
16:44 < verbosus> danbri: +1
16:44 < karlcow> Yes I think danbri, it's much needed +1
16:44 <@danbri> If he prefers to self-host, that's cool, but I think people are looking for something (albeit informal) at somewhere like W3C, to stop the proliferation of overlapping / redundant schemata.
16:44 < dino> danbri, that would help SVG. Right now, there is a feeling that we don't need RDF to expose EXIF. So anything on the w3.org site would help.
16:45 < verbosus> Also, is there any kind of license on kanzaki's work?
16:45 <@danbri> Any objections to my inviting Kanzaki's to help move a copy of his schema to  w3.org-hosted namespace URI?
16:45 < karlcow> nope
16:45 <@danbri> dino, that's good to know.
16:45 <@danbri> Hearing no objections:
16:45 < mortenf> how'd "we" update it?
16:45 < marccanter> go 4 it!

16:46 <@danbri> MortenF, that's a good question. We have some precedents with www-rdf-calendar collaboration, perhaps something like that.
16:46 < _joshua> [off] how do i make some text in a comment be a link?
16:46 <@danbri> Libby, got a pointer / quote to how that is done?
16:46 < mortenf> ok, i was also thinking of copyright / process
16:46 < libby>  links : [blabla|http:///hgfdgh]
16:46 < deltab> [off] like [http://...|this]
16:46 < karlcow> mortenf, we can proceed with a mailing-lis for discussion.
16:46 < libby> either way works.
16:47 < verbosus> mortenf: how about something like the RSS 1.0 WG?
16:47 <@danbri> s...o...m...e...thing like that. RSS1 WG had issues (I guess mostly political).
16:47 < libby> see chump manual: http://usefulinc.com/chump/MANUAL.txt

16:47 -dc_rdfig:#rdfig- Added comment D23.
16:47 < verbosus> danbri: you have more experience than us on this one, any suggestions?
16:47 <@danbri> I would look for something consensual, lightweight, not at this stage a working group. The RDF Calendar collaboration is the closeest I've seen.
16:48 < _joshua> pete: good link, thank you
16:48 <@danbri> see http://www.w3.org/2002/12/cal/ [[
16:48 <@danbri> At the Bristol workshop, we agreed, roughly...
16:48 <@danbri>     * we announce all changes to the schema www-rdf-calendar
16:48 <@danbri>     * if anyone screams, within a week or so, we'll back out the changes (for further discussion)
16:48 < mortenf> iirc, the calendar phrasing was something like "no objections within a week, accepted"
16:48 <@danbri> If the last modified dates below are more than a few months old, active developments have likely ceased. If things ever actually stabilize, we'll change this status message.
16:48 <@danbri> ]]
16:48 <@danbri> for how we agreed to do the rdf cal thing.
16:48 < mortenf> :)
16:48 < libby> gets some data, do soem tests, generayte a schema from data?
16:48 <@danbri> yup. it's all in cvs so can be rolled back
16:49 < libby> generating schema from data is fun; or at least getting a guide to the schema form the data
16:49 < _joshua> what's IPTC?
16:49 <@danbri> The big motivation, to my mind, is to get an Exif ns nailed down so we can move on to the interesting stuff: mixing Exif image metadata with other metadata about the image, the where/when/who/what of its content and context...
16:49 <@danbri> OK, we have 10 minutes left. I'm open to suggestions re how to use that.
16:50 < mortenf> one more thing re exif schema: i'd like for a set of controlled textual values, instead of numeric codes
16:50 < _joshua> I'd like to see some project idea brainstorming, just to explore the space of what could be done
16:50 <@danbri> In http://rdfig.xmlhack.com/  I noted Agenda fodder: SVG update; Copyright issues; Versioning; ...
16:50 -!- shellac [~pldms@2001:618:400:3946:230:65ff:fe04:abba] has joined #rdfig
16:50 <@danbri> We've had SVG update...
16:50 < karlcow> IPTC = International Press Telecommunications Council
16:50 < _joshua> Right, I googled for it.
16:50 < GregElin> SVG update?
16:50 < karlcow> It's a press professional organisation which has created standards
16:51 < karlcow> for describing information
16:51 < verbosus> mortenf: you mean the ability to access a field by its name instead of its EXIF code?
16:51 <@danbri> (Dean's mini-resentation earlier updated us re SVG)
16:51 <@danbri> MortenF, I'm sympathetic to that (textual values); I wonder Kanzaki's view esp re I18N. Will ask.
16:51 < mortenf> verbosus: well, instead of orientation:0 i'd like orientation:top/left
16:51 < mortenf> good point...
16:51 < dino> not specific to SVG, just that we're most likely the group that will do something soonest
16:51 < karlcow> I have a question for the schema.
16:51 < _joshua> D: [http://www.iptc.org/site/standards.html|IPTC standards] - assuming it's the "JPEG File Information" bit.
16:51 -dc_rdfig:#rdfig- Added comment D24.
16:51 < karlcow> Which versions of EXIF?
16:52 <@danbri> I guess someone needs an action to investigate (c)/IP issues if we're looking to host Exif-based schema on w3.org.
16:52 < mortenf> it seems exif version only add new fields, no changes, can anyone confirm?

16:52 <@danbri> Libby, yes. Could you gimme a hand doing that?
16:53 < karlcow> ok we will go with that version but making it clear that this is the schema for this version.
16:53 <@danbri> Versioning... traditionally a can of worms. Would someone here have time to take a look into versioning situation and report back to www-rdf-interest?

16:53 < mortenf> hmm, karlcow, i think we'd want a stable namespace uri, no versioning 
16:53 < Thorisson> Does anyone know of efforts to describe geometric shapes in RDF?

16:58 < verbosus> mortenf: I seem to recall there is already something like that.
16:58 <@danbri> ...hope to have some progress to report their re Exif work, but mainly focus on describing content of images.
16:58 < mortenf> really?
16:58 < libby> so that's a pretty general chat danbri - not just svg - any image description?
16:58 < verbosus> mortenf: let me google a bit.
16:58 < Bert> Is anybody writing an EXIF-to-RDF and vice-versa converter? Would be nice if that converter could then be a plug-in in the DOM that Dean proposed. And that DOM could in fact have a plug-in API, since W3C wants to work on plug-ins...
16:58 < mortenf> thx
16:58 < karlcow> Thank you danbri for being the chair on this meeting.
16:58 < GregElin> I hope we can pull back to more general level for Image Description chat. Really just see who is doing what.
16:58 <@danbri> Thorrison, I'll circulate some stuff before then that I think you'll be interested in.
16:58 < libby> thanks danbri
16:58 < GregElin> Not a beauty contest -- more like a social mixer.
16:58 <@danbri> Yes, not just SVG. we should clarify wiki on that front.
16:58 < verbosus> danbri: thanks!
16:59 < GregElin> Thank you very much, Danbri!
16:59 <@danbri> Yeah, I was joking re beauty, didn't mean to imply the other schemas were ugly.
16:59 <@danbri> They're all special... in their own way :)
16:59 < dino> Bert, vice-versa would be interesting.

17:03 < _joshua> verbosus: gotcha. I want to see some in-the-wild stuff
17:04 < _joshua> Ooh, I have an idea

17:04 -dc_rdfig:#rdfig- H: quick and dirty camera manufacturer EXIF support survey idea from _joshua

17:04 -dc_rdfig:#rdfig- Added comment H1.
17:04 < mortenf> verbosus, i've actually seen that doc before, but i've noticed that my relatively new camera only uses a subset of the defined fields, and imagined that others would do the same. What i'd like is a way to "join" separate but identical fields into one in the schema
17:04 < verbosus> _joshua: that was what mortenf was asking a while ago.
17:05 < _joshua> H: identify manufacturer by filename via http://diddly.com/random/about.shtml

17:05 < mortenf> canon 10d
17:05  * danbri reviews http://rdfig.xmlhack.com/ notes
17:05 < verbosus> I have a Canon G3 and some EXIF libraries out there choke on its metadata.
17:06 < verbosus> mortenf: is it canon's fault? ;-)
17:06 <@danbri> edd, have you ever gotten Exif out of your p800 pics? my extraction tool finds nothing...
17:06 < mortenf> heh, could be, i guess they don't adhere to standards

17:07 < mortenf> and then there are the maker note, which is all distinct, but perhaps possible to merge as well
17:07 < verbosus> but if the EXIF people don't enforce their own standards there's no reason for us to work with EXIF at the moment.
17:08 < edd> danbri: not tried
17:08 < verbosus> verbosus: with RDF of just with plain EXIF?
17:08 < verbosus> sorry, I mean to say that one to _joshua :-)
17:08 <@danbri> edd, my tools always try, as written with rotation-metadata in mind (for my recently-lost PowershotS45, sob...)
17:08 < _joshua> verbosus: indeed; but may I please try? :)
17:09 < libby> it could be pretty interesting for them to see compliance maybe?
17:10 < mortenf> i'd like a table of fields versus cameras/models support
17:10 < mortenf> perhaps i should just start one in a wiki somewhere...
17:10  * dino curses all the lazy camera manufacturers that just flip exif orientation bits rather than rotate the image.
17:11 < mortenf> hmm, i actually like that; let me handle it myself, if needed
17:11 < verbosus> mortenf, libby: there should be an EXIF validator :-)
17:11 < mortenf> heh
17:11 < libby> heh
17:11 < libby> same issue with icalendar stuff we've been looki g at
17:11 < dino> mortenf, my take is that 99% of people want the image the right way up. the other 1% can deal with it :)
17:12 < mortenf> i guess, yeah :)
17:12 < dino> i have no real problem rotating, but it annoys me that I have to.
17:12 < dino> my curse goes double for the cameras with inbuilt orientation sensors
17:13 < karlcow> I wonder if there's a list of all tools supporting the EXIF information. Most of them are able to read it, only a few can write it.
17:13 < mortenf> danbri, would it be ok if i started an "exif support matrix" on the esw wiki, near ImageDescription?
17:13 < dino> those guys don't even have the excuse of takes too much memory, they could just read data off the CCD the wrong way around ;)
17:13 <@danbri> mortenf, fine by me.
17:13 < karlcow> Many softwares also mungle the EXIF data in the image when the image is rotated, cropped, resizd, etc.
17:14 <@danbri> DanC sometimes complains when people make Wiki topics that aren't "patterns", but I've never fully understood what 'counts' as appropriate...
17:14 < pete> note that http://www.ba.wakwak.com/~tsuruzoh/Computer/Digicams/exif-e.html is a good start on various manufacturer-specific stuff 
17:14 < karlcow> mortenf, don't forget to add the supported OS
17:14 <@danbri> so long as the doc has reasonable self-explanation is fine by me!
17:14 < maxf> the question of modifying the exif data along with the picture is quite trucky
17:14 < maxf> tricky
17:14 < mortenf> os?
17:14  * karlcow can't use BreezeBrowser
17:14 < karlcow> OS = Operating System.
17:15 < mortenf> hmm, but i'm refering to exif generated by camera?
17:15 < verbosus> maxf, indeed.
17:15 < karlcow> oh :) sorry thought you were talking about a matrix of products :p
17:15 < verbosus> That's why I reckon putting the metadata in an external RDF document makes it easier to deal with it.
17:15 -!- Bert [bbos@lanalana.inria.fr] has left #rdfig []
17:16 < maxf> verbosus: because it would be easier to edit?
17:16 < karlcow> maxf: because you will not lost them
17:16 < maxf> or because it would prevent software to mess with it?
17:16 < verbosus> Yeah.
17:16 < mortenf> yeah, and also i wouldn't want to download a bunch of images to find the rdf - to find the images i'm interested in...
17:16 < verbosus> Both, actually.
17:16 < maxf> agreed
17:17 < karlcow> HTTP trafic is good point
17:17 < karlcow> I wish we could do an HEAD http://www.example.org/image.jpg, and have the metadata
17:18 < mortenf> that would be nice, yes, but then there's uriqa :)
17:18 < karlcow> without transfering the image
17:18 < dino> ok. here's a simple question for you metadata types: when you say "image" do you include the original, the thumbnail, the medium sized version that is good for web page, etc?
17:18 < mortenf> we use foaf:thumbnail :)
17:19 < verbosus> dino: my digicam embeds the thumbnail in the same file.
17:19 < karlcow> hmm you mean image as a set of different representation of the same image
17:19 < karlcow> :)
17:19 <@danbri> The notion of image is pretty slippery
17:19 < mortenf> ... to point to smaller versions, recursively

17:19 -dc_rdfig:#rdfig- J: http://www.tasi.ac.uk/2000/09/rdfmeta/ from danbri

17:19 -dc_rdfig:#rdfig- Titled item J.
17:19 < dino> verbosus, yes, but that's only one thumbnail. I usually have 3 different sizes
17:19 < maxf> Shame Bert has left. His RDFPic has the metadata in the picture, but the http server can send just it on request.
17:19 < dino> this is one reason why I don't like RDFpic
17:20 <@danbri> J:Pretty ancient doc I wrote on RDF and PNG when at ILRT (1999/2000)
17:20 -dc_rdfig:#rdfig- Added comment J1.
17:20 < karlcow> dino: I would say no from the exif point of view. You have the size of the image in exif data and so it's particular to a specific version.
17:20 < verbosus> dino: what I upload to the web is a scaled version of the original one. So yes, i do have three sizes as well, but one is not published.
17:20 < dino> aha! then why do you want to preserve the EXIF when you modify the file Karl? :)
17:20 < mortenf> an example: http://www.wasab.dk/morten/2003/07/photos/8/
17:21 < karlcow> dino the problem is not preserving them :) the problem is not having them anymore.
17:21 < karlcow> For example when you do a rotation with some software, everything has disappeared.

17:22 -dc_rdfig:#rdfig- Added comment J2.
17:22 < karlcow> It was the case in old version of ZoomBrowser of Canon.
17:22 < dino> yeah i know, but cropping for example is a new image.
17:22 <@danbri> Dammit, why does Guha have to have thought of everything first? ;)
17:22 < JibberJim> Yes, but EXIF is still useful for the new image, if it's just a cropping.
17:22 < verbosus> karlcow: are you saying that the world needs an EXIF-friendly image editor/photo management software?
17:23 < mortenf> i publish descriptions of original image, then point to thumbnail(s)
17:23 < JibberJim> If you've atually edited the pixels though, I guess saying it was taken by Joes Camera is not so useful.
17:23 < karlcow> yes cropping is a new image and some part of the information should be modified and some other should be kept.
17:23 < dino> my (dumb) feeling is that one "image" includes all the different sizes and a single RDF file.
17:23 < mortenf> ... hoping that the tools finding the images will display thumbnails first
17:23 < dino> of course, JPEG2000 will solve all this :)
17:23 < maxf> ha! JPEG2000
17:23 < dino> and JPEG2000 has yet another metadata format iirc.
17:23 <@danbri> ha?
17:24 < maxf> just the name sounds so pass?!
17:24 <@danbri> it sounds so futuristic! when will it be ready? :)
17:24 < karlcow> Dino viewed from the description side, you can have a bag of images which have the same origin and are different versions.
17:24 < karlcow> and so as you said the file describe all of them
17:24  * dino apologises for being a metadata dummy
17:25 < dino> they intend to rename to JPEGXP
17:25 < mortenf> ;)
17:25 < karlcow> no dino.... :) it's cool. questions and ideas are always good. :p and you are not the dumbest.
17:25 < karlcow> Dumb contest now
17:25 < verbosus> mortenf: what EXIF extraction tool do you use in your gallery script?
17:26 < mortenf> the one linked earlier, http://www.wasab.dk/morten/2003/07/sempex/ - Perl with Image::Info
17:26 < karlcow> for my gallery, I'm using iviewmediapro. which extract metadata in my html templates

17:44 < mortenf> nope
17:45 <@danbri> I'd be interested in trying gnomemeeting, ichat etc here sometime...
17:45 < edd> Difficult to use with firewalls.
17:45 < GregElin> I did. Chatted with Pete Kaminiski and Marc Canter.
17:45 <@danbri> my voice over ip line is down for some reason, so can't call us cheap
17:45 < GregElin> Are you on a Mac, Dan?  I recently bought an iSight.
17:46 < GregElin> I can plug it in.
17:46 <@danbri> I have a powerbook laptop + the hack for using old usb cams... but am about to dissapear into telecons again!
17:46 <@danbri> #rdfig in multimedia would be interesting
17:46 < verbosus> danbri: I switched to a powerbook as well :-)
17:47 <@danbri> foafbot is a part of that puzzle... esp now edd using the Twister/twisty framework... we could have a page showing photos of everyone here
17:47 <@danbri> :)
17:47 < GregElin> Well, if people are willing to leave IRC, I can put a webchat channel together with a little multimedia.
17:47 < edd> danbri: Twisted. And that's rather a nice idea :)
17:47 < GregElin> Want to try that? 
17:47 <@danbri> I think we're quite wedded to IRC for now, due to proximity of rest of freenode... 
17:47 < edd> Highly unlikely that people would want to move from IRC. It's a good lowest common denominator.
17:48 < mortenf> greg, as long as you keep the barrier of entry low, i.e. no requirements for IE or so...
17:48 < GregElin> Tell you what...why don't later this week or early next we have a small group test in a webchat with multimedia?  Next Wed?
17:48 <@danbri> if it was gated to irc, mebbe
17:48 <@danbri> same issue re Jabber migration
17:48 < JibberJim> Soon SVG will solve it by allowing us to write IRC clients in SVG, we can then do image stuff in SVG clients, which talk SVG commands on a 2nd channel, to do shared whiteboard etc.
17:48 < GregElin> We could try a gateway to IRC.
17:48 < mortenf> next week? ;)
17:49 <@danbri> edd: yeah it'd be a good way to demo the multi-headed foafbot...
17:49 <@danbri> +1 re irc in svg
17:49 < libby> dont worget nextwed is calendar chat at 1600UTC
17:49 < libby> no clashing!
17:49 <@danbri> gateway would be good, so folks could live in multimedia land or stick to their trusty irc clients
17:49 < libby> s/worget/forget/
17:49 < GregElin> well we'll just try something casual sometime then.
17:50 < GregElin> Oh? Wordnet?
17:50 < deltab> JibberJim: Jabber might be good for that
17:50  * danbri bbiab
17:50 < libby> it's ok, just I dont want ckashes. could haveti earlier, say
17:51 < JibberJim> Integrating anything with SVG clients at the moment means tieing us to Win32 IE, however 1.2 should allow us to write an actual IRC client within SVG itself.
17:51 < GregElin> JibberJim: Yikes!
17:52 <@danbri> or web browser...
17:52 < GregElin> talk about discussing photos
17:52 < GregElin> brb
17:52 < deltab> you wouldn't actually need irc implemented within svg, just a connection between them

18:25 < ericP> yeah
18:25 < libby> sorry, didnt mean to sound ungrateful!
18:25 < ericP> friggin' ingrate

18:26 < libby> heheh
18:26 < mattb_> provenance!
18:26 < ericP> ie, do you want specific URLs to access parts of it (that is, URLs that are different from a query GET url)?

18:27 < mattb_> and a few times here
18:27 < ericP> mattb, what are your provenance requirements?
18:27 < mattb_> i love sesame, but i'm waiting for something a bit like redland's contexts

18:28 < jeen> heh
18:28 -!- chrisGoad [~cg@65.122.147.25] has quit []
18:28 < ericP> ie, do you want to do a query that joins data from different sources (for instance, POSTS) and find out which triples came from which source?
18:28 < jeen> it's getting there, or at least something similar. you can now do in-memory inferencing.
18:28 < libby> so at the moment I can query the underalyign store directly and get provence; or query the rdf and not get provence.
18:29 < libby> I've alos liked the annotator to the fuile name in rdf I generate, so at a pinc=h i could get it using that: http://swordfish.rdfweb.org/photos/genfiles/ilrt/026406035665294925.rdf
18:29 < jeen> argh
18:29 < ericP> libby, yeah, but i'm working on packaging up the provenance data too
18:29 < libby> but that's a bit aslow with mine
18:29 < ericP> so you have API access to the provenance but no way to serialize it?
18:30 < libby> yep I think so, re triples from which sources. not as good but simpler is to find any sources files that say soemthign about this picyure

18:34  * mattb_ returns
18:34 < mattb_> it's more than just provenance, of course...
18:34 < ericP> algae2 does it by giving accessors to special properties like the attribution (provenance)
18:34 < mattb_> it's wanting to annotate the model without adding to its serialisation
18:34 < mattb_> iyswim
18:34 < mattb_> might want to attach provenance, trust metric, timestamp, that sort of program-internal data
18:34 < ericP> "without adding to its serialisation", i don't understand
18:35 < libby> without reification?
18:35 < mattb_> i don't want to add reified statements to the model itself
18:35 < mattb_> just want to annotate its database form
18:35 < mattb_> if i request a serialisation, the additional info is invisible in the rdf
18:35 < mattb_> it's only available through an API

18:36 < ericP> i view it thus:
18:36 < ericP>   most implementations use quads
18:37 < ericP>   RDF data model does not suppoert quads, but instead reification
18:37 < ericP>   a particular form of reification may be chosen to convey what all the implementations do with quads.
18:38 < ericP>   this "standard" form of reificiation may not be the current sanctioned form of RDF reficiation.
18:38 < ericP>   this is because of the superman problem
18:39 < ericP>   (aka referential opacity)
18:39 < shellac> when did the morning star problem become the superman problem, btw?
18:40 < ericP> oops, i don't know the "morning star" problem. is that the house style sanctioned way to discuss referential opacity?
18:41 < shellac> it's what you often find in the literature
18:41 < shellac> but it may be old skool :-)
18:41 < ericP> i'm down with the old skool, my man

18:44 < ericP> is that the morning/evening star problem?

18:45 < ericP> so i was thinking i would do something like this:

18:45 < shellac> it's actually slightly different to the superman case, since it doesn't explicitly mention beliefs
18:45 < ericP>   use convetional RDF reification with some extra standard-ish props to describe the relationship to the provenance.
18:46 < shellac> but it can be recast that way
18:46 < ericP>   define a SOAP encoding that had the same semantics as that but allowed the statements to be expressed directly rather than reified.
18:46 < ericP> .
18:47 < libby> soap things sounds interesting
18:47 < shellac> there was one (hackish) idea you haven't mentioned AFAICT
18:47 < libby> I'd avoid reification like the plague though
18:47 < ericP> but tim and sandro threw some rocks, namely referential opacity and parseType="quote"
18:48 < shellac> ericP foo:believes <ref_to_rdf_doc>
18:48 < shellac> or even
18:48 < ericP> see http://www.w3.org/2001/12/attributions/#SOAP for a way-oversimplified example of the SOAP shortcut
18:49 <@danbri> ericp, you had a test case re RDF and I18N a few weeks back, re lang tagging and RDFCore appearing to violate what one might call princple of least suprise...

18:54 < ericP> that may be it. not sure.
18:56 < ericP> shellac, do you mention the referential approach to provenance just for completeness?
18:56 < ericP> ie, do you feel it is sufficient and a good way to manage assertions about sets of statements?
18:57 < shellac> hmm - well it's broken semantically
18:57 < shellac> but it makes a kind of sense (to me)
18:58 < ericP> how is it broken vs. potentially over-constraining?
18:58 < shellac> it's been raised before as a way to get round the serialisation horror
18:58 < shellac> it's broken simply because foo:believes isn't in model & syntax
18:59 < shellac> but reification is, iirc

19:01 < shellac> I like having two (or more) rdf subtrees in an xml doc - that's quite cute
19:02 < shellac> but this stuff doesn't provide an impermiable barrier between reified and stated content
19:03 < ericP> libby, how does one report query results, multiple documents?
19:03 < libby> what with provenance?
19:03 < libby> mumble
19:03 < ericP> i think query results force the issue
19:04 < libby> i.e. how to get that information bac out again?
19:04 < ericP> ie, it's practical to say "i beleive X" and write X in a sepparate document.
19:04 < libby> so, you're saying, that _is_ practical?
19:05 < ericP> bit it's impractical to give fourty eleven different document fragments that combined produce the query resutls
19:05 < ericP> libby, well, maybe not practical, but doable
19:05 < libby> righ
19:05 < libby> t
19:05 < ericP> more doable than when reporting inferential joins over many sources.
19:06 < libby> so could you not refetch the relevant document fragments if requested? most people wont want that
19:08 < ericP> my windows are dirty, who do i know that knows someone who can fly?
19:08 < libby> I guess depends on how important trust is.
19:08 < ericP> go get lois's document and lex's document and apply owl:sameAs to whatever you find there
19:09 < ericP> the prob is you can't even say "apply owl:sameAs to the following statements" as we still don't know how to state the statements.
19:09 < ericP> shellac, M&W reification works for me 'cause i always report proofs.
19:10 < ericP> s/i/algae/
19:11 < ericP> algae will say that lois says "Superman can fly" and Lex says "Superman is Clark Kent" and Modus Ponens+lois+lex says "Clark Kent can fly".
19:13 < ericP> but if i dump my database in a reificed form and someone applies owl:sameAs substitutions to it, and i get it back and de-refify it, i learn that lois says "Clark Kent can fly"
19:13 < ericP> oof. my world interacting with other peopls world breaks if they think they can substitute into my data.
19:14 < ericP> tim argued that i use parseType="quote" rather than some soap encoding.
19:14 < ericP> bit of an impasse there
19:14 < ericP> either <SOAP><myHairBrainedScheme><RDF></></></>
19:15 < ericP> or <RDF><tim'sHairBrainedScheme><RDF></></></>
19:15 < ericP> mine is more legal, his shows a clearer migration

23:07 -!- Morbus [morbus@morbus.totalnetnh.net] has joined #rdfig
23:08 < sethl> is it just me, or is there a disconnect in RSS between an <item> and the URL it often is about?  Often, an <item> is the URL to the blog entry, but the entry itself is about another URL.  Through standard RSS usage, I can't seem to easily jump between the <item> and the URL it's talking about.
23:09 < sethl> I was thinking about how to discover what people are talking about, and I can't seem to do it via RSS, which seems odd.  I'd think that's be a feature of RSS.
23:09 < sethl> I think blogdex accomplishes this via full text indexing on the blog entries
23:09 < bitsko_> sethl, that's a very accurate read on the vagueness of that particular element in RSS (both flavours)
23:10 < sethl> bitsko_: no doubt, but I can accept that, for now, <item> means "the entry in the blog that this RSS represents"
23:10 < bitsko_> Pie/Echo/Atom, by comparison, makes the purpose of <link> clear, and doesn't itself specify using, for example, dc:source
23:11 < sethl> I'd love an easy way to say, in RSS, "this <item> contains comments about <uri>, <uri>, and <uri>"
23:11 < bitsko_> yes, <item> itself refers to the blog entry
23:11 < sethl> right now, my RSS reader can't tell me, the user, "what things (uri's) people are blogging about"
23:12 < sethl> kinda misses the mark, IMHO
23:12 < bitsko_> note that <item><link>'s original definition was "this <item> contains a comment about <link>"
23:12 < sethl> that I can agree on, and I can see it's usefullness
23:12 < bitsko_> but that definition changed over time with vague usage.
23:12 < sethl> pooey on that
23:13 < sethl> is p/e/a's intent to replace RSS soup?
23:13 < bitsko_> there is no RSS specified way to get all the remaining referenced links, unless the publisher also includes the full body content, which you can then cull the URIs from
23:13 < dajobe> bitsko_: it reconnects for me.  There is a loop if it actually dies/exits but that's rare
23:13 < sethl> yeah, and often times they don't.  and it seems that moveable type strips the URIs right out of the <description>
23:14 < bitsko_> sethl, combining the features of RSS and the weblogging APIs is the main focus of Pea, yes
23:15 < bitsko_> dajobe, k.  I think I must have hit one of the rarities ;)  do I need to configure Apache (as in .htaccess) to allow content-negotiation for the bookmarks to go to XHTML or RDF?

23:23 < wkearney99> or, for that matter, to say any number of other 'describing' thing about the location involved.
23:23 < dajobe> why not use datatypes, <foaf:near rdf:datatype="&units:km">10</foaf:near>
23:24 < wkearney99> well, I'm thinking along the lines of <foaf:near rdf:id="aa" rdf:resource="http://www.daml.org/2001/10/html/airport-ont/iata#DCA"/>
23:24 < wkearney99> and then using a separate rdf:Description wrapper elsewhere to say /how near/ 
23:25 < JibberJim> did you see the geoOnion vocab?
23:25 < dajobe> this is multi-value property stuff.  The original RDF spec said use rdf value.  <foaf:near rdf:value="10" geo:units="km"/>
23:25 < dajobe> you could add more there to say near to what other point, but /me not geo-person
23:26 -!- mea_culpa [mea_culpa@12-212-98-134.client.attbi.com] has joined #rdfig
23:26 < wkearney99> ah, so it'd be <rdf:Description rdf:about="#abc"><foaf:near rdf:value="10" geo:units="miles"/></rdf:Description>
23:27 < dajobe> still doesn't say near to *what*
23:27 < wkearney99> where #abc is <foaf:near rdf:id="abc" rdf:resource="http://www.daml.org/2001/10/html/airport-ont/iata#DCA"/>
23:27 < dajobe> ugh, that's reification
23:28 < wkearney99> so the path here is foaf:person has a foaf:near with an ID of 'abc' and then elsewhere I'm saying the 'abc' relationship is described as one being '10 miles'

23:40 < dajobe> I guess
23:40 < dajobe> using reification just scares me
23:41 < wkearney99> oh, don't get me wrong, I'm not ignoring the reification issue.  I'm approaching this from a document-centric position.  The querying back against a mass of triples would indeed present interesting reification questions.
23:43 < dajobe> what you need is a property that is (10km from) - multi part that is including (10 integer, units km, from property).  If RDF allowed bnodes as properties (it doesn't), you could declare one and then hang those properties off it.  I think.
23:43 < JibberJim> Have you seen http://esw.w3.org/topic/GeoOnion wkearney99?

23:46  * wkearney99 jibberjim: yes I've seen geoOnion.
23:46 < wkearney99> now, technically, I suppose saying my own foaf:Person is 'near' something is probably sort of ridiculous.

23:51 -!- Morbus [morbus@morbus.totalnetnh.net] has quit [Remote closed the connection]
23:51 < wkearney99> but within the confines of a person's own statements about themselves, saying "they're near" something is possibly usefully abstract.
23:52 < mortenf> foaf has based_near, for that reason
23:52 < chrisc> yeah, true :-)
23:52  * wkearney99 right, based_near, tnx.

15:56 < dajobe> that's not the latest

15:56 < dajobe> ah, yes that's it
15:57 < dajobe> I find an irc log from march with eikeon and he was aware then of the change, should be in.

16:37 < dajobe> very early
16:37 < swh> is "AND ?title LIKE '/^RdQL/i'" standard syntax?
16:37 < swh> i relly hope so

16:44 < libby> cheers AndyS
16:44 < AndyS> swh: at the moment the synatx would be "AND ?title =~ '/^RdQL/i'" for full regular expressions (c.f. Perl)
16:44 < swh> AndyS: great, thanks
16:45 < AndyS> ... theer is no LIKE as such (i.e. case insensive substring) as SQL databases provide.  Some provide full POSIX regex of course
16:45 < AndyS> What do you think?  Should there be an operation that captures the special case of LIKE?
16:46 < swh> AndyS: not if we have regex, I think thats enough
16:46 < swh> LIKE is a bit too SQL
16:46 < AndyS> That's personal pref - abstract away from the SQL details (which differ between DBs sometimes in the corner cases) but ...
16:47 < AndyS> ... sometimes its too hard just having the general mechanism.  It is reasonably easy to spot some regexs and see ...
16:47 < libby> like is kinda handy though
16:47 < AndyS> ... they are easy cases.  Just more work for implementers :-(

16:51 < AndyS> What capabilities does it have?
16:51 < swh> AndyS: I think its the perl one
16:51 < dajobe> BTW AndyS, your RDQL grammar is ambiguous near PLUS/MINUS, plus do we really need bitops, etc.  There are some other things too :)

16:52 < AndyS> dajobe: Maybe its time to sort out the set of operators - I picked up a complete set (from a Java grammar).  To date, implementations do what they
16:53 < AndyS> need which seems fine.  The user community might like a core set to depend on.
16:53 < AndyS> swh: Posix: ah.

17:03 < dajobe> it's ambig since PLUS can be in Multiplcative *mutter* and also in UnaryExpressionNotPlusMinus
17:03 < timbl> Last call WG went out 2003-01-23
17:03 < dajobe> at least as I transleted the BNF
17:03 < dajobe> I have test cases now, so I'll see
17:04 < swh> dajobe: I treated unary +/- as parto f the integer, but maybe thats a bug
17:04 < AndyS> Ah - the old binary/unary thing in context insensitive lexers.
17:04 < dajobe> the javacc allows stuff that can't be done in lex/yacc
17:05 < dajobe> but apart from that...
17:06 < AndyS> So it occurs when we have "?x + +3" : shouldn't the binary form be choosen over the unary form?
17:06 < AndyS> (drop me and swh email as you're in a call)
17:06 < dajobe> that's what the ordering in yacc choses for that conflict
17:07 < AndyS> general question: is it time for a more formally defined defn of what the core of RDQL "is"?     (pace em)
17:07 < swh> AndyS: votes++
17:07 < dajobe> it took me some time to decode that BNF
17:07 < dajobe> especially since the terminals weren't decoded into tokens
17:07 < swh> me too, I think I got it wrong too
17:08 < dajobe> so I had to work out what SUCHATHAT was

18:02 < libby> oh yes? where is it?
18:02 < CaptSolo> don't now if it has been aggregated already
18:02 < JibberJim> EXIF into analog, I'd do that if I could be bothered to find a tool.
18:03 < CaptSolo> Jim: you mean to add EXIF to scanned photos?
18:03 < CaptSolo> i'm afraid that then you'd have to note on paper the aperture, exposition time, etc.
18:03 < CaptSolo> as very few analog cameras would record such info electronically
18:04 < JibberJim> It's more useful, as I can't afford a decent digital camera, where knowing the settings I took it on would be useful, but knowing what settings I took on a crappy digital is useless.
18:04 < JibberJim> Hmm, How does the camera know which lens you've got connected?
18:04 < JibberJim> mortenf?
18:04 < CaptSolo> Jim: absolutely agree - that's why I do not have a digicam yet
18:04 < CaptSolo> Jim: it does not (most probably, though who knows)
18:05 < JibberJim> Which kind of devalues the usefulness of EXIF knowing the other settings!
18:05 < CaptSolo> but it knows at what focus distance it is focusing. 
18:05 < CaptSolo> so if you do not have too many lenses with overlapping distances, you'd probably figure out
18:06 < CaptSolo> Libby: my home page should have a link in it's <head>
18:06 < libby> ok
18:06 < CaptSolo> url is http://kaste.lv/~captsolo
18:07 < mortenf> yeah?
18:07 < CaptSolo> i see danbri posted link to updated foaf specs, shall take a look at it
18:07 < JibberJim> Does your camera know what lens you've got connected?
18:07 < mortenf> nope, have to tell it myself
18:07 < mortenf> i think...
18:07 < JibberJim> Ah, right but you can do that at least to make it into the EXIF, that's okay then.
18:08 < mortenf> no, i have to make the rdf statements myself
18:08 < CaptSolo> I guess adding FOAF info to the RSS feed from my blog would be good
18:09 < CaptSolo> libby: does any1 add to RSS feeds the information about the author? in FOAF?

13:16 < darobin> ChrisDodo: the DateTime stuff is what's considered best practice for date&times in Perl. It's actively developed, if something's missing and you can make a case for it, it'll be added
13:18 < ChrisDodo> from what i can tell, the ISO bit only parses dates in?
13:18 < ChrisDodo> anyway, the w3c subset of ISO doesn't seem to be handled anywhere.
13:19 < ChrisDodo> if there's someone to speak to, tell me. atm I've just subclassed Date::ICal
13:19 < darobin> for DateTime you prolly want to speak to Dae Rolsky
13:19 < darobin> Dave even
13:20 -!- libby [~libby@82-32-4-244.cable.ubr01.azte.blueyonder.co.uk] has joined #rdfig
13:20 < ChrisDodo> once I've hacked this project out, I'll investigate. It seems mad that there's no Perl module for outputting w3c compliant datea and times.
13:20 < darobin> but then, if you just want a ISO dates with the dashes, Time::Piece + a simple fmt should do the trick
13:21 < darobin> yeah, I guess no one's used that subset of iso
13:21 < darobin> if you hack something, hack it into DateTime, all the rest is slowly moving towards deprecation
13:21 < ChrisDodo> but if you want to do anythiing RSS, it's a neccessity.
13:22 < darobin> except Time::Piece, but that's a foundation bit
13:22 < darobin> what does XML::RSS do?
13:22 < ChrisDodo> heh, already hacked Date::ICal, will see about DateTime when I thtow it all away and rewrite :)
13:22 < ChrisDodo> XML::RSS just takes dublin core elements - i.e. you provide the date in a suitable format.
13:22 -dc_rdfig:#rdfig- Label XML not found.
13:22 < darobin> IIRC Date::ICal wad going to be switched to using DateTime inside :)
13:22 -!- shellac [~pldms@2001:618:400:3946:230:65ff:feb0:c95e] has left #rdfig ["I like core dumps"]
13:23 < ChrisDodo> but I validate now, and that's most of my worries.
13:24 < darobin> perl -MTime::Piece -le "print gmtime->datetime" # prints 2003-08-17T10:23:35
13:24 < darobin> is that the format you want? Time::Piece is core
13:24 < ChrisDodo> damn Perl and it's many ways of doing things!
13:24 < darobin> :)
13:24 < ChrisDodo> I think you have to have time zone info as well to validate.
13:24 < ChrisDodo> i.e. add a Z to the end ;)
13:26 < darobin> then replace ->datetime with -strftime($yourFormat) :)
13:28 < ChrisDodo> y'see I just search for ISO, and got Date::ISO... Time::Piece didn't hit me as what I wanted. Oh well.
13:29 < darobin> yeah, common issue. CPAN needs better metadata
13:29 < ChrisDodo> irc seems to function well as a search engine ;)

22:48 < dajobe> wfm
22:49 < JibberJim> wfm2
22:49 < Schuyler> I'm getting "unknown host redland.opensource.ac.uk"
22:49 < dajobe> try www. in front
22:49 < dajobe> or just librdf.org
22:49 < Schuyler> word
22:49 < dajobe> or just www.librdf.org I meant
22:50 < Schuyler> anyway I'm working on an application that collects metadata about web browsing, email, etc and provides a search function
22:50 < dajobe> I just made better (old) redland core, python + perl debs, if anyone cares
22:50 < Schuyler> sort of a personal Google kinda thing
22:50 < dajobe> old=not latest CVS, that is.  anyway
22:50 < Schuyler> with a potentially collaborative component
22:51 < Schuyler> does it make sense to build an RDF ontology and use redland as the back end?
22:51 < dajobe> how much ontology use do you want?
22:51 < dajobe> if so then a store that did inference would be more appropriate
22:51 < dajobe> although slower, :)
22:51 < Schuyler> well, it's unclear to me how inference would be useful in this instance
22:52 -!- obra [jesse@pallas.eruditorum.org] has joined #rdfig
22:52 < Schuyler> looking for something fast ATM
22:52 < dajobe> I'd say experiment with something light and see how you get on
22:52 < Schuyler> ah here's my co-conspiratior
22:52  * obra waves
22:52 < Schuyler> that was the plan
22:52 < Schuyler> I was just wondering if something like redland really did make sense as a back end
22:52 < dajobe> what impl language?
22:52 < Schuyler> perl, probably
22:52 < Schuyler> although that shouldn't matter in the end
22:53 < Schuyler> I'd like to have a sufficiently generic ontology plus well-defined (probably REST) interfaces
22:53 < dajobe> well, I'd say yes since I made all my big redland apps using the perl api.  For me it was fast (to develop) and operate
22:54 < dajobe> there's also the pure perl thing RDF::Core, haven't used it myself
22:54 < Schuyler> how's the stability? it seems to be making Edd weep a lot lately
22:54 < Schuyler> not really caring about pure Perl
22:54  * dajobe summons edd to deny that
22:54 < Schuyler> SWIG's good enough

22:55 < edd> stability's good, Schuyler, and getting better because i keep stresstesting it
22:55 < Schuyler> word
22:55 < edd> foafbot is one heck of an extreme usecase
22:56 < mattb> it works for me
22:56 < Schuyler> howso? how big's your database?
22:56 < edd> it's more a case of "how wild's my RDF"
22:56 < Schuyler> fair enough
22:56 < mattb> dajobe's very responsive to submitted patches too ;)
22:56 < Schuyler> mattb: that was my sense, to be sure
22:56 < edd> no other toolkit can match the speed
22:57 < edd> which is a big consideration
22:57 < Schuyler> yeah
22:57 < dajobe> thanks, fan club!
22:57 < Schuyler> previous attempts to make SQL-based RDF-y thingies have ended in weeping and gnashing of teeth

22:57 < mattb> Schuyler: which language are you talking about here?
22:57 -!- edd [~edd@starway.heddley.com] has left #rdfig ["beer owed"]
22:57 < mattb> the python wrapper on redland's hand more exercise than some
22:57 < dajobe> that's still dooable, if you use somebody elses.
22:57 < Schuyler> eh Perl, probably, but whatever
22:58 < mattb> yeah, my sql rewriting thing doesn't work for large datasets
22:58 < mattb> poor little query optimizer doesn't know what's hit it
22:58 < danbri> s/large/some/
22:58 < mattb> good point
22:58 < danbri> depends on the query, and the data structure
22:58 < Schuyler> mattb: which is too bad, because it's a very elegant algorithm
22:58 < obra> "When you join a table to itself 30 times and have > 100,000 rows, it might be a tad slow"
22:58  * mattb looks forward to fast native query for redland
22:58 < danbri> ...even a small but weird dataset can confuse it; whereas a big pile of data might be ok to query, if you ask something simple
22:59  * mattb gotta dig into shellac's esquish

16:57 < JibberJim> I'd be interested in looking if we could have dates with optional years in the format to - good for repeating events, you could just say --12-26  Boxing Day for example, but that's not on the Agenda.
16:57  * DanC doesn't consider the agend written in stone
16:58 < DanC> you can express "every year on 12 December" in icalendar, and hence in our RDF calendar schema
16:59 < mortenf> G:see also [reply from mortenf|http://www.wasab.dk/morten/2003/08/cal/ip.txt] that has yet to make it to the list
16:59 -dc_rdfig:#rdfig- Added comment G2.
16:59 < JibberJim> yes, but it's rather verbose iso8601 lets me specify that just in the date, without needing anything more.
17:00 < DanC> why does it help to be able to express it in fewer characters?
17:00 < DanC> you can certainly make up a property that has those semantics, but if there isn't widely deployed software that groks, it's not too interesting.
17:01 < JibberJim> because dates would be useful in RDF formats used primarily by people scared of RDF, (FOAF/RSS etc.)
17:01 < DanC> dc:date works just fine if you don't want any machines to grok.
17:02 < JibberJim> And as iso8601 does support it, I'm not sure why machines shouldn't - I'm not thinking specifically of iCalendar integration, but using rdfCalendar elsewhere.
17:03 < libby> wanna add it to agenda jibberjim?
17:03 < DanC> I'm not saying machines shouldn't. In fact, it's straightforward to write cwm rules to convert from jibberjim:fancyDate to rdfcal:uglyDate.
17:03 < DanC> but what's not straightforward is to get those cwm rules (or the equivalent) widely deployed in usable software.
17:04 < JibberJim> The use case that motivated this, was dates of events in the FOAF world, people want to give different info (some people don't want to give the year they were born, others don't want to give the actual date but want to give year)
17:05  * DanC likes the cyc vocab for such things
17:05 < JibberJim> those irregularities can be resolved if we simply say use an iso8601 calendar date, but currently that would mean a new vocab, that's all.
17:06 < DanC> I don't much care for compressing lots of complex semantics like that into a character-level syntax.
17:06 < _joshua> Hey DanC
17:06 < JibberJim> I was wondering if it could be integrated, you're probably right though that it would be too expensive in the icalendar world.
17:06 < DanC> I prefer to say it more directly: "I was born in 1967" => { :me cyc:startDate [ xsdt:year "1967"]}.
17:07 < DanC> or "I was born on December 9" = { :me cyc:startingDate ... hmm.. I forget how to say it's on the 9th day of december in some year
17:08 < _joshua> DanC, I had an idea I wanted to share with you. also some code for something unrelated.
17:08 < DanC> hi _joshua
17:08 < JibberJim> significant overhead then though for tools to compare mine and your ages, if I used :me foo:birthEvent year:1973-12-10 etc. 
17:09 < DanC> significant overhead compared to what? are you claiming that calculations on iso8601 dates don't have a lot of overhead?
17:10 < JibberJim> They have an overhead handed off to an iso8601 lib, and not in understanding RDF vocabs.

18:45 < mortenf> (if any)
18:45 < DanC> if you're going *from* RDF, you *have* the namespaces.

18:45 < DanC> in what namespace?
18:45 < mortenf> the prodid derived one
18:45 < DanC> why?
18:46 < mortenf> how else would i export them?
18:46 < DanC> I don't expect you would.
18:46 < mortenf> well, that's what's keeping our tests from passing now...
18:47 < DanC> toIcal.py is its own "product".
18:47 < mortenf> hm...
18:47 < DanC> so take the x- properties out of the .rdf that you're starting with.
18:47 < mortenf> ok, but why did we "invent" a prodid namespace then?
18:48 < DanC> hmm... good point.

19:02 < _joshua> gnuplot also but I have troubles.
19:02 < _joshua> there are better visualization packages for unix though.
19:02 < _joshua> Xgobi, scigraphica
19:02 < libby> everyone ready to talk about calendaring?
19:03 < mortenf> sure

19:04 < libby> the schedule is in http://dfig.xmlhack.com, as www-rdf-calendar isn;t working

19:05 < libby> calendar meet agenda item E: prodid schemas
19:05 -!- DanC changed the topic of #rdfig to: Rdf Calendar ScheduledTopicChat 1600Z for 90min http://rdfig.xmlhack.com/
19:05 < libby> I havn;t done anything about my action here, sorry
19:06 < libby> did I see something about it in the logs?
19:06 -!- jql [~jql@ip68-6-184-214.sd.sd.cox.net] has quit ["using sirc version 2.211+KSIRC/1.2.4"]
19:06 < mortenf> well, remotely related...
19:06 < mortenf> as in, what should toIcal and ical2rdf do...
19:06 < libby> that wseems related...
19:07 < DanC> we know (er... well, we decided, anyway) what ical2rdf should do...
19:07 < mortenf> convert everything?
19:07 < libby> right, should it just chuck away x-props...
19:07 < libby> tricky
19:07 < libby> we culd do soem common ones
19:08 < DanC> are there any x- properties that we think are good ideas? I can't think of any
19:08 < mortenf> but then we wouldn't need the prodid specific namespaces
19:08 < libby> I guess this relates to mixing names[aces in ical which I was thinking about in relation to J: ids for events
19:08 < mortenf> i don't have a strong preference...
19:08 < libby> but only uin the other dirsction
19:09 < libby> sorry, not having looked at it properly yet, I don;t know
19:09 < libby> maybe continue the action, see what we get
19:09 < mortenf> the reason i brought it up, is that out test-cases won't match (atm)
19:09 < mortenf> s/out/our/
19:09 < libby> i.e. roundtripping
19:10 < libby> ?
19:10 < mortenf> yep
19:10 < DanC> D:see also [rdf-calendar list archive|http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-calendar/], [RdfCalendar wiki topic|http://esw.w3.org/topic/RdfCalendar] and [RDF Calendar Workspace|http://www.w3.org/2002/12/cal/]
19:10 -dc_rdfig:#rdfig- Added comment D6.
19:10 < DanC> for example, which test case, mortenf?
19:10 < libby> it'd be simple to write a utility for stripping out the x-props right?
19:10 < mortenf> e.g. mtg
19:11 < DanC> E:hmm... we agreed on a design for taking X- properties *into* RDF... but what about the other direction?
19:11 -dc_rdfig:#rdfig- Added comment E2.
19:11 < mortenf> or perhaps a switch/option for ical2rdf to make it drop them?
19:11 < mortenf> that'd be the easy for-now solution
19:11 < libby> whateever you think mortenf
19:11 < DanC> x:wrTimezone is hooey
19:12 < mortenf> i'd be fine with that, i've already hacked toIcal to preserver the prodid
19:12 < DanC> i.e. I'm fine with taking the x:wrTimezone hooey out of the mtg.rdf test data file.
19:12 < DanC> preserving the prodid seems questionable.
19:12 < mortenf> it was just an e.g. i suspect there are others...
19:12 < mortenf> yeah, perhaps
19:12 < DanC> i.e. toIcal should probably write out a prodid referring to itself
19:13 < DanC> I'm happy to look at others. I don't feel prepared to generalize.
19:13 < mortenf> sure, but what about the x- properties then
19:13 < mortenf> they'd have to be dropped
19:13 < DanC> I haven't seen any x-properties that I'm interested to support in toIcal.py yet
19:13 < mortenf> i was thinking a blind conversion
19:13 -!- darobin_ [~robin@APastourelles-107-2-5-217.w217-128.abo.wanadoo.fr] has joined #rdfig
19:14 < DanC> but I'm not prepared to generalize and say "let's not support any x- properties in toIcal.py" until we've looked at more of them.
19:14 < mortenf> but that only makes sense if the prodid is preserved
19:14 < DanC> please *don't* think blind conversion. There lies madness.
19:14 < mortenf> quite possible, but what's the purpose of toIcal again :)
19:15 < DanC> toIcal knows the semantics of all the properties it deals with.
19:15 < DanC> its purpose is to syntactically export calendar data from RDF KBs to .ics format
19:15 < mortenf> ok, how about if i add that --drop-x option to ical2rdf and you look at x-props in general?
19:16 < DanC> the mtg.rdf file, as it is, is bogus. We shouldn't endorse it by keeping it in our test data.
19:16 < libby> th one in cal/test?
19:16 < DanC> yes, http://www.w3.org/2002/12/cal/test/mtg.rdf
19:16 < libby> because of the xprops
19:17 < DanC> oh! it used to lack a timezone declaration. I see it has one now. so it's not bogus any longer.
19:17 < libby> ok well those need egenerating then
19:17 < libby> <mortenf> ok, how about if i add that --drop-x option to ical2rdf and you look at x-props in general?
19:17 < libby> - "you" = me? danc?
19:17 < mortenf> anyone but me:)
19:17 < libby> heh
19:17 < DanC> why a --drop-x option?
19:17 < DanC> i.e. what's wrong with the way it works now?
19:17 < libby> at one stage I went through ading tz stuff to the tests
19:17 < mortenf> to make round-tripping testable
19:18 < DanC> round-tripping *is* testable if you start with no x-properties in your .rdf data.
19:18 < mortenf> ok, but quite a few of the tests do have x-props
19:18 < DanC> so let's fix those, one by one.
19:18 < libby> it might be more consistent to remove x-props from the ics files
19:18 < libby> shoudl be simple to fix w a perl script right?
19:18 -!- darobin [~robin@APastourelles-107-2-5-23.w217-128.abo.wanadoo.fr] has quit [Read error: 60 (Operation timed out)]
19:18 < DanC> i.e. let's look at each one and see if there's any good reason for the x- property
19:19 < mortenf> ok, but then again: what's the point of prodid ns
19:19 -!- shellac [~pldms@2001:618:400:3946:230:65ff:feb0:c95e] has quit ["I like core dumps"]
19:19 < DanC> it's not clear that the prodid namespaces have any real value, that's true. But it's sorta sunk cost now.
19:19 < libby> well it might be useful for other reasons - for seeing what things app[s need not included in ics
19:19 < mortenf> so why remove them from the test data, if we might want to keep them later on?
19:20 < DanC> let's *look at each one* 
19:20 < libby> ok
19:20 < libby> now?
19:20 < DanC> I *know for a fact* that the x:wrTimezone in mtg.rdf is bogus cuz I looked at it.
19:20 < DanC> now is OK by me. someday is too.
19:20 < mortenf> it's also in e.g. Chiefs
19:21 < libby> I think that might be a hangover from when we didn;t add tz to files manually if they were missing
19:22 < mortenf> ok, i'll just strip them pseudo-manually when testing for now
19:22 < DanC> anybody know if apple:iCal is willing to eat calendars that don't have x:wrTimezone in them? i.e. do we lose interoperability with apple:iCal if we delete X-Wr-Timezone from the .ics files?
19:22 < libby> I would think we do but not sure
19:22 -!- libby_ [~libby@dhcp-10.ilrt.bris.ac.uk] has joined #rdfig
19:23 < DanC> hmm... wrCalname could have some value... we could say it's a subproperty of dc:title
19:23 < libby> they are aware that the tz handling is an error, and promised to fix it, but that was a while ago and no new releases since
19:24 < libby> makes sense

19:36  * DanC wonders what I was expected to do that I didn't do
19:36 -!- dajobe [~dajobe@hoth.ilrt.bris.ac.uk] has quit ["Leaving"]
19:37 < libby> nothing, just say stuff

19:37 < mortenf> heh
19:37 < libby> :)
19:37 < mortenf> ok, let's move on then
19:37 < libby> moretn, do you want to say a bit about the regression tests?
19:37 < libby> cool
19:37 < libby> calendar meet agenda item F: regression tests for .ics->.rdf and vice-versa
19:37 < mortenf> sure.
19:37  * DanC tried phoning George about his testing progress; lost
19:38 < fsparv> can anyone explain this exception to me: Exception in thread "main" com.hp.hpl.jena.datatypes.DatatypeFormatException: 1 is not a Number
19:38 < fsparv> I sure thought 1 was a number :)
19:38 < mortenf> i've tried converting back and forth, got stuck on x-props and "wrong" prodid from toIcal, will be able to do more now
19:39 < mortenf> i plan to run through all tests, check for mismatches
19:39 < libby> so the aim is to be able to rondtrip between a certain set of tests or all the tests we have...?
19:39 < mortenf> one thing: the sequence from mtg.ics is not converted
19:39 < libby> ok, all tests
19:39 < mortenf> all?
19:39 < mortenf> yep
19:39 < libby> well the schema is generated from 3 I think
19:39 < libby> ok
19:39 < mortenf> at least that's what i'll try
19:40 < libby> we should be tryting to expand number of tests we use to generate that
19:40 < libby> cool
19:40 < MikeM> hehe.... Roy would be proud... all of our web services interfaces also have equivalent GET interfaces....
19:40 < mortenf> unless there are already comments on the sequence issue, i'll just continue
19:41 < mortenf> eor
19:41 < libby> I'm not sure we ever addressed it 
19:41 < libby> go for it
19:41 < mortenf> F:continues...
19:41 -dc_rdfig:#rdfig- Added comment F2.
19:41 < libby> just as an asside, I noticed that the rdF ical schema doesn;t seem to use domain and range: http://sw1.ilrt.org/discovery/2003/08/validation/validate.jsp?schema=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2002%2F12%2Fcal%2Fical%23
19:42 < mortenf> heh 
19:42 < DanC> doesn't it?
19:42 -!- JimJibber [SJ@dsl-217-155-143-66.zen.co.uk] has joined #rdfig
19:43 < DanC> i.e. where would you expect to see a domain or range that you don't see one?
19:43 < libby> hm
19:43 < libby> now I look, uses rangeIntersects
19:43 < libby> so maybe just showing a limitation of the tool
19:43 < DanC> no, rangeIntersects is different from range
19:44 < libby> yes, but it says something about range
19:44 < libby> I thought it said nothing
19:44 -!- JibberJim [SJ@dsl-217-155-143-66.zen.co.uk] has quit [Read error: 104 (Connection reset by peer)]
19:44 < DanC> i.e. if you see { :fido :eats [ a :Chicken] } you don't know that :eats only takes :Chickens as objects
19:45 < DanC> but you do know that :eats :rangeIntersects :Chicken
19:45 < DanC> as a human, you might be able to promote that to :eats :range :Food.
19:46 < libby> so can only ahve one domain in RDFS but multiple ranges?
19:46 < libby> .e. could someone extend the schema at any timew to include another range anyway? or a domain?
19:46 < DanC> you can have multiple ranges in RDF. but that means the object is in *all* those classes.
19:46 < libby> not any. ok
19:47 < libby> anyway, just something I noticed. thansk for clarification
19:47 < libby> move on?
19:47  * DanC lost my rdfig window...
19:48 < libby> calendar agenda item G: Interpretation properties and timezones
19:49  * DanC supposes he closed it after looking up George's phone number, not realizing other tabs in that window were still relevant to an ongoing task
19:49 < libby> this has been on the agenda a good while...I finally got around to writing a message to rdf-calendar (not rdf-interest)
19:49 < mortenf> and i tried to reply...
19:49 < libby> oh yep, not read that yet, hang on....
19:50 < DanC> hmm... reviewing that validator output, a few things do seem to be missing; e.g. { ical:prodid rdfs:domain ical:Vcalendar }
19:50 < DanC> I was gonna generate some stuff like that from the icalendar RFC
19:50 < libby> that'd be cool

19:54 -!- ndw [~ndw@brmea-proxy-1.Sun.COM] has quit ["Client exiting"]
19:54 < libby> I'm not that keen on datatypes, but we certainly could do
19:54 < DanC> I dont' see how what ip.txt proposes is interestingly different from what we have.
19:54 < mortenf> but as stated, i'm not sure about the implications, and subdatatyping isn't really possible...
19:54 < libby> I'd like to have tz as a uri too
19:55 < mortenf> just a thought, i'd like it as well, if it was possible to say something about the tz
19:55 < libby> well DanC it stops the merging nastiness right? http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-calendar/2003Aug/0002.html
19:55 < libby> (I'm not sure I've interpretted it right as XML/RDF from http://esw.w3.org/topic/InterpretationProperties
19:55 < libby> )
19:56 < DanC> no, it doesn't stop the nastiness.
19:56 < libby> no?
19:56 < DanC> no
19:57 < mortenf> ideally, we'd have to have a prpoerty for each timezone...
19:57 < libby> because if we say the datetime objects are the same we have the same issue?
19:57 < DanC> right.
19:57 < DanC> i.e. there's nothing wrong with the existing ical schema as long as people realize that 2pm central != 3pm Eastern. But that's *very* fragile.
19:57 < libby> but this way at least we could have 2 dtstarts from different timeszones
19:58 -!- aharth [~a@136.guest.isi.edu] has joined #rdfig
19:58 < DanC> we *want* to say that the meeting is at time X, where X is 2pm in Chicago and 3pm in New York.
19:58 < DanC> that is: that's the way people normally talk.
19:59 < mortenf> but is this expressable in owl?
19:59 < libby> right I guess the other way sort implies that they could be different times, i.e. not syncronised
19:59 < DanC> owl doesn't have multi-column keys, no.
20:00 < DanC> yes, you can think of them as not synchonized. But that seems... I dunno, silly and counterproductive.
20:00 < DanC> I'm conflicted...
20:00 -!- arnarl_ [~arnarl@ti221110a080-3603.bb.online.no] has joined #rdfig
20:00 < DanC> I know what my preferred model of timezones is, but it's not at all clear that iCalendar agrees with me. And the semantics of our namespace are the semantics of iCal, not some semantics we may prefer.
20:01 < libby> hm
20:01 < libby> what would your prefered model look like?
20:02 < DanC> :event :dtStart [ chicago:tz "14:00"; newYork:tz "15:00"].
20:02 < mortenf> how the other way around; tz:newYork?
20:03 < DanC> where @prefix chicago: <http://www.w3.org/2002/12/cal/tzd/America/Chicago#>.
20:03 < mortenf> with tz:*, it'd be possible to have a controlled vocabulary
20:03 < DanC> that's another issue, mortenf. You end up with all the timezone definitions in one file, which is sort of a pain.
20:03 < mortenf> true
20:03 -!- dajobe [~dajobe@82-32-3-30.cable.ubr01.azte.blueyonder.co.uk] has joined #rdfig
20:04 < libby> but your way around would be difficult to query danc....
20:04 < DanC> with chicago:tz, it's not only possible to have a controlled vocabulary, that vocabulary exists today: http://www.w3.org/2002/12/cal/#tzd
20:04 -!- niq [~nick@walkham.demon.co.uk] has joined #rdfig
20:04 < DanC> difficult how so, libby? gimme an example query that's easy with the existing schema and hard with mine?
20:05 < DanC> you don't really want to query for "2pm in some timezone" do you?
20:06  * libby will have to think, but I've comonly grabbled all the dtstarts/dateTimes and also their timezones
20:07 < libby> you could still ake queries of that sort but would have to do a partial match on the property which (in implementation experience) slows things down
20:07 < libby> I think
20:07 < libby> butthere's stuff you culd do, e.g. normalize it all
20:07 < DanC> "partial match on the property"? what do you mean by that?
20:07 < DanC> can you give me an example query?
20:08 < libby> well you could query with the property as a varaibal, or in some languages do a substring match on the property name
20:08 < mortenf> on ns only?
20:08 < libby> yeah maybe
20:09 < libby> it's perhaps not so important
20:09 < mortenf> so we're stuck with the ical model?
20:09 < DanC> stuck?
20:10 < libby> (?event ical:dtstart ?dt) (?dt ical:dateTime ?value) would work currently
20:10 < DanC> isn't querying with the property as a variable supported in all the RDF query systems?
20:11 < DanC> change that to (?event ical:dtstart ?when) (?when ?tz ?value) (?tz rdf:type tz:TimeZone).
20:11 < libby> yep I would guess suppported in many; just an imlementation observation that probbaly slower
20:11 < libby> I'm not sure thatthat shoudl stop us
20:12 < mortenf> <DanC> I know what my preferred model of timezones is, but it's not at all clear that iCalendar agrees with me. And the semantics of our namespace are the semantics of iCal, not some semantics we may prefer.
20:13 < libby> I'm not sre that that really matters moortenf, as we've been working out the semnatics of whats really a syntactic format ourselves
20:13 < libby> as long as we get the essesnce of what icalendar seems to mean....
20:14 < libby> where it's possible to tell what that is
20:14 < mortenf> so it would be possible for us to model the data/time as danc showed?
20:14 < DanC> that's the question.
20:14 < DanC> some issues:
20:14 < libby> I'd say, not impossible :)
20:15 < DanC> (1) icalendar files don't use global names for timezones. so picking a URI from our controlled vocabularly would be tedious, typically, and implossible in some cases
20:15 < DanC> (you can always make up a local property name, and add a :genProp rdf:type :Timezone triple, but I wonder about round-tripping that...
20:15 < DanC> )
20:16 < DanC> (2) icalendar uses the same syntax for recurring times and non-recurring times. 2pm in Chicago every tuesday doesn't correlate to *any* particular recurring time in Paris.
20:17 < DanC> (maybe that's a non-issue)
20:18 < mortenf> i think 2 is ok
20:19 < mortenf> and re 1, it seems tz's in ical are identified by the olson ones?
20:19 < mortenf> hmm, except for when it's ...Z
20:19 < DanC> here's where I am: (a) I'm uncomfortable with the way our RDF timezone properties work, and I suspect applying the InterpretationProperties pattern would help, but (b) I'm able to get work done with the status quo, and (c) I haven't found sufficient motivation to design and implement something better
20:20 < mortenf> one reason for changing to ips would be that others look at this case re this exact issue
20:20 < DanC> typical ical practice uses the olson names. but the ical spec allows totally arbitrary timezone definitions, like "it's -0500 on tuesdays, and +300 from 2004 to 2005, then back to -0600 except on Thursdays"
20:20 < mortenf> ouch
20:21 < libby> right cos it's supposed to be defined in the file right
20:23 < libby> hm
20:23  * mortenf is reading rdf2445
20:24 < libby> given limited effort available to do this work, I wonder if the status quo might be the best thing to do
20:25 -!- Morbus [morbus@morbus.totalnetnh.net] has quit [Read error: 104 (Connection reset by peer)]
20:26 < libby> it seems to me that if we can work with it, it might be better declaring the vocab 'finished' and moving on to more interesting things, rather than starting another big job
20:26 < libby> that's just my feeling
20:27 -!- Morbus [morbus@morbus.totalnetnh.net] has joined #rdfig
20:27 < libby> any other thoughts?
20:28 < mortenf> wouldn't it be possible to use Z or Olson when present, otherwise define a "local" type, by the VTIMEZONE info?
20:28 < libby> sounds lausible
20:28 < libby> plausible even

20:29 < libby> we should be wonding up at this stage
20:29 < mortenf> not that it'd be easy converting, but...
20:30 < libby> mortenf, you seem to care....do you have an apps which won't work with the current system?
20:30 < mortenf> no, just gut feelings...
20:30 < libby> that we'll regret it later?
20:30 < mortenf> perhaps
20:31 < mortenf> i'm actually quite in aggreement with danc, except that i think now's the time for a change
20:31 < libby> well, given that we're out of time, I'm happy to action myself to try and start a conversation about this on the mailing list (whan it's up). think that would help?
20:31 < libby> it's unclear how to resolve this to me.
20:31 < mortenf> sure
20:31 < mortenf> yep
20:32 < libby> given that there are only really three of us active here....but I get a fair few requests for help and advice with using the vocab, i'd prefer to get it finished...
20:32 < libby> ok, I'll do that
20:32 < mortenf> fair enough
20:32 < libby> G:ACTION libby summarise this discussion and send to www-rdf-interest
20:33 -dc_rdfig:#rdfig- Added comment G3.
20:33 < libby> I just mean, I think it's probably not enough energy to make the change!
20:33 < libby> s/it's/there's/
20:33 < libby> might be better to note the issue and write it all up.
20:34 < libby> so...anyone want to meet again?
20:34 < mortenf> got it, but if it's mainly a question of the converter programs...
20:34 < mortenf> hmmm...
20:34 < mortenf> we still go item H as well
20:35 < libby> well, if you fancy writing it up as a followup, then that'd be cool, i.e. flesh it all out, maybe show how converter would work....

20:36 < mortenf> i think a uuid based on seems the way to go, whether it be a uri or an ifp
20:36 < libby> what makes you say that?
20:36 < mortenf> they are already there in some cases
20:36 < libby> consistency with RFC 2445?
20:36 < libby> ok
20:37 -!- swh is now known as swh_away
20:37 < mortenf> yep
20:37 < DanC> I don't really understand the motivation for H. Yes, it's nice when things have established URIs, but it's hard to establish them when their owners aren't interested.
20:37 < mortenf> which is why a uuid based ifp may be better
20:37 -!- jimH [~chatzilla@180-233.mam.umd.edu] has joined #rdfig
20:37 < DanC> icalendar requires that events have uids; do you need something other than that, libby? what for?
20:38 < libby> uuid would be fine I think
20:38  * MikeM hopes to have the UUID uri document updated by the end of the month... (co-author is on vacation)
20:38 < libby> better if an inverseFunctionalProperty
20:38 < libby> cool MikeM
20:39 < MikeM> the code in the appendix is wrong and _lots_ of folks were cutting and pasting it directly into their code (ick!)
20:39 < DanC> I'm not sure whether ical:uid is an owl:InverseFunctionalProperty or not...
20:39 < libby> ouch
20:39 < libby> well, I guess that's what I'm asking
20:39 < mortenf> in rfc 2445 it says: This property defines the persistent, globallyunique identifier for the calendar componen
20:39 < libby> right
20:39 < DanC> consider: in my calendar, { :e1 ical:uid "...73"; ical:summary "I hate this meeting; it's so dull." }
20:40 < libby> what I'm inetersted in is the case where 2 people define the same event in their own calendars, and want to say, this is the same event
20:40 < DanC> in Fred's calendar: { :e2 ical:uid "...73"; ical:summary "best meeting of the week" }
20:40 < mortenf> but you're talking about the same meeting, so it's still right
20:41 < DanC> if ical:uid is an owl:InverseFunctionalProperty, then we conclude :e1 = :e2 and :e1 ical:summary "best meeting of the week", "I hat this meeting; it's so dull".
20:41 < DanC> (if we merge the calendars)
20:41 < mortenf> so you don't want events to have ids at all?
20:42  * DanC doesn't grok the question
20:42 < libby> so it loses the provenance of each statement?
20:42 < mortenf> it seems it the basic issue of provenance etc.
20:42 < DanC> no, provenance is orthogonal.
20:42 < DanC> The question is: do we mean for the subjects of those two ical:summary statements to be the same thing?
20:42 < mortenf> hence my question...
20:43 < DanC> i.e. is it one event, described in two calendars, or are they separate event-things?
20:43 < libby> perhas you mean: event identify conditions are very tricky indeed, better not touch them with a bargepole?
20:43 < DanC> no
20:43 < danbri> subjects in the rdf:subject sense, ie. things not terms...
20:43 < libby> I think it's very useful to say, x and I went to the same event. but maybe better to say it outside of icalendar itself
20:43 -!- ndw [~ndw@brmea-proxy-3.Sun.COM] has joined #rdfig
20:43 < DanC> why better?
20:44 < libby> because then we could use foaf:homepage, as danbri suggested
20:44 < libby> though not sure that makes a great eal of difference, cos that's an inversefunctionalrpoperty too
20:44  * danbri would prefer see identity rules inside the cal vocab, but hasn't given it enough thought yet
20:45 < libby> I'm not sure ho mcuh it matters....but people do what to do this, say that events are the same thing, e1=e2
20:45  * mortenf still hasn't grasped danc's position
20:45 < DanC> summary is sorta fuzzy... but consider alarm properties.
20:45 -!- sniffles [~steph@modemcable117.220-131-66.nowhere.mc.videotron.ca] has quit [Remote closed the connection]
20:46 < DanC> when, in my calendar, it says { :e1 ical:uid "...81"; ical:alarm [ :hoursBefore "2"] } and in your calendar it says { :e2 ical:uid "...81"; ical:alarm [:minutesBefore "5"]}...
20:47 < DanC> ... does it make sense to say that we were both setting alarms on the same event?
20:47 < DanC> I go back and forth. Maybe it does.
20:47 < mortenf> ok, good point, i wouldn't want an alarm for every participant...
20:48 < libby> would it make any diference to you DanC if the events were merged using a non-ical ns...? guess not...
20:48 < mortenf> so, it seems that an owl/rdf identifier of sorts is not desired
20:49 < libby> kind of annoying, but I can see the logic
20:49  * libby has to go home shortly, and we're out of time
20:49 < libby> wanna try meeting up again guys?
20:49 < mortenf> sure

20:51 < mortenf> me?
20:51 < libby> heh
20:51 < libby> well, sometimes bad stuf will happen if they are merged
20:51  * DanC has not rendered an opinion, has carefully avoided "good", "bad" and such terms
20:51 < mortenf> perhaps a super-event could be modelled
20:52  * mortenf had noticed that...
20:52 < libby> I guess this is how say apple ical models different calendars
20:52 < libby> I wonder if they use uuid
20:52 < libby> I'd say 10 alarms going off was pretty bad
20:53 < libby> mortenf, I can probably do 3rd, 10th...17th...
20:53 < libby> sept
20:53 < mortenf> 3, 10 fine, 17 not
20:54 < libby> 10th?
20:54 < mortenf> ok with me
20:54 < libby> cool
20:55 < libby> anyone object?

21:04 < DanC> if these were credit card fraud rates, Visa would be in trouble.
21:04 < MikeM> The thing that scares me is that some companies are so willing to stop spam that they're willing to break the ubiquity of SMTP...
21:04 < Cardinal> Which isn't a solution..  It's not like spammers can't adapt to new protocols.
21:05 < DanC> er... the ubiquity of SMTP *is* broken. My email inbox is no longer a reliable way to reach me.
21:05 < sandro> ready for secure whitelisting + special exception mechanism?   :-?
21:06 < MikeM> cardinal, but would you like the alternative to be that you can't send mail to anyone at microsoft without running microsoft's proprietary mail application?
21:06 < DanC> I was talking with Boyer, a c.s. prof at U.T. ... he wanted to email a snipped of code to a colleague. Couldn't do it. incoming mail filters blocked it.
21:06 < DanC> (incoming at the colleague's org)
21:06 < ndw> sigh.
21:07 < MikeM> that's currently what's being proposed in certain circles: Microsoft and a few others will go off and develop their own version of SMTP that you can't get documentation for unless you sign their EULA....
21:07 < ndw> This particular round of the .pif virus is the worst I've seen. I'm getting hundreds a day, and at 100k each they're too big even with broadband access.
21:07 < ndw> No mail to or from MS clients. That'd be...bad, right?
21:08 < libby> yeah...maybe 1 out of 20 mails 'real' for me

21:09 < ndw> Yeah. I guess it would be bad. But it'd be bad in so many ways.
21:09 < DanC> an idea occurred to me the other day: backbone guys stop sending packets on port 25 except from registered IP addresses. To register your IP address, you send a self-addressed, stamped envelope to the gods.
21:10 < Cardinal> Eureka!
21:10 -!- apluc_aem is now known as edtivrsky

21:10 -!- edtivrsky is now known as EdTivrsky
21:10 < ndw> (Although it's been very nearly static in practice)
21:10 < DanC> (well, 1st you get a random number from mail-gods.org, send it to them by post; they send another one back to you, and you enter that via http again)
21:10 < MikeM> Dan, that's essentially one of hte idea: you only do mail acceptance when you can setup an SSL session between you and the sendeing MTA. That way you can verify who it is from....
21:10 < _joshua> DanC: What about callbacks? You recieve mail from x@y.com; you callback y.com and say "did x@y.com really send mail to me@my.com?" and they can say "Yes, I don't know, No" or whatever
21:11  * ndw runs off to test something that requires bringing X all the way down...
21:11 -!- ndw [~ndw@brmea-proxy-3.Sun.COM] has quit ["Client exiting"]
21:11 < _joshua> if y.com is a faked, y.com will say no. if y.com is a spammer, you make up a domain name and ask about it. "Did you send email to foo@bar.com?" and if they say YES you know they are lying and are a spammer.
21:12 < DanC> I'd prefer a p2p system, but I have a *large* number of email peers, and I'm not sure I wanna wait for all of them to get with some new system.
21:12 < MikeM> anyone seen eric miller lately
21:12 < _joshua> Gotta start somewhere

21:12 < Morbus> i can't stand "email me back 'yes' to confirm you want me to read your mail' systems.
21:13 < _joshua> callbacks could be implemented without smtp support, which is also ap lus
21:13 < Morbus> don't make your spam problems MY problems too.
21:13 < _joshua> Morbus: I am not talking about making humans do things
21:13 < MikeM> thanks, dan...
21:14 < DanC> I find it pretty ironic that the Internet Mail Consortium is sorta fading into obscurity as spam is becoming the net's biggest problem.
21:15 < MikeM> Its fading simply because Paul didn't want to do it anymore... IMC was always just Paul
21:15 < DanC> so I gather.
21:16 < DanC> the IRTF spam group seems to be doing some interesting stuff
21:16 < DanC> we gotta get that low-tech anti-forgery stuff DNS stuff deployed right quick.
21:17 < MikeM> now all his time is taken up by internationalization issues...
21:18 < MikeM> you mean DNSSEC?
21:18 < _joshua> Hmm!
21:18 < DanC> no, DNSSEC is not low-tech...
21:18 < DanC> I mean http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-danisch-dns-rr-smtp-02.txt
21:18 < _joshua> Why not stash a public key in a TXT record for a domain, and then everyone who wants to send mail from that domain signs with the private key?
21:19 < _joshua> taht's the MF header, right?
21:19 < DanC> a shared private key? heh.
21:20 < _joshua> Well, I could have my smtp server sign things on the way otu with the right key.

22:40 < GNUWookie> cause your name. I wrote to sun on getting the source code for ipcs
22:40 < GNUWookie> i wanted to know what syscalls are used
22:40 < GNUWookie> but truss did the trick as well
22:40 < ndw> Glad you found a solution
22:41 < GNUWookie> yeah, it is pretty cool, sun has an api call.

23:52 < karlcow> sbp? :)
23:53 < JibberJim> sbp's a font spotter karlcow
23:53 < sbp> sorry. the combination of a missive on RDF's practical use and a page set in Gill Sans is overwhelming
23:54 < karlcow> ah ok :) lol
23:54 < karlcow> happy you like it :) (if you like it)
23:55 < sbp> still going through it, looks very good
23:55 < karlcow> comments are welcome. My frenglish is always a bit broken.
23:55 < ndw> Who's got a page in Gill Sans?
23:55 < sbp> you converted the XML to N3 by hand?
23:55 < sbp> Norm: see L, above
23:55 < karlcow> sbp, with an XSLT
23:56 < sbp> good. is the XSLT linked?
23:56 < karlcow> hmmm :) not from this document.
23:57 < karlcow> I will try to find it :)
23:57 < sbp> cheers
