11:01 < TheStar> Anyway, I'm learning databases, as it's part of the project I'm doing...
11:02 < TheStar> gtg - dinner...  Pizza!!!
11:02 < TheStar> Assume that I'll become a regular on fridays ;)
11:02 < TheStar> cya
11:02  * radix goes to rummage for food, as well
11:03 < jemfinch> Daverz: I'm having some real trouble with it.
11:04 < hendry> dash: According to : http://download.sourceforge.net/moin/?M=D # It has not been updated for more than 6th months
11:04 < dash> hendry: so?
11:05 < jemfinch> Daverz: you still around?
11:06 < hendry> dash: Seems little else... :/
11:06 < Acapnotic> or, if you feel like using zope, you get your wiki there (zwiki).  I don't think I'd install zope just for the wiki, though.
11:07 < VladDrac> get a wiki at freezope.org :)
11:07 < hendry> I guess installing Zope is not that easy
11:09 < Acapnotic> oh, installing zope was pretty easy on my debian box, but it's the whole web server.  So if you were just looking for a module or cgi to add on to your existing web server, zope's not it.

11:10 < hendry> I don't have root, I am just a luser
11:10 < hendry> on a RH based system
11:11 < Daverz> jemfinch: sorry, got hungry...trouble installing it?
11:11 < hendry> where can I find docs on Howto make a patch ? all i get in the linux-kernel howto with google
11:12 < jemfinch> Daverz: no, it installs fine.
11:12 < jemfinch> Daverz: it just won't save any of my databases.
11:12 < jemfinch> someone mentioned the problem on the list, but they focused on his other problems instead of this problem.
11:12 < Daverz> did you include the access code, like 0666
11:13 < jemfinch> lemme see...
11:13 -!- tendergrin [~no@sdn-ap-018txhousP0178.dialsprint.net] has quit []
11:14 < jemfinch> yup.
11:14 < jemfinch> still nothing.
11:15 < jemfinch> I db.close(), and when I look at the file, it's there but with 0 bytes.
11:15 < Daverz> what are the access bits on it?
11:16 < jemfinch> I used 0644
11:16 < Daverz> ok
11:16 < pyn> TachYon26 (matkor@beauty.ant.gliwice.pl) has joined on ircnet
11:17 < jemfinch> Daverz: no ideas?
11:17 < Daverz> jemfinch: can you save stuff with the sqlite command-line?
11:19 < jemfinch> yeah, it works from the command line.
11:21 < jemfinch> Daverz: I'm getting ready to drop an email to the mailing list, I can't figure this out.
11:21 < Daverz> good luck...it's a pretty cool little database engine
11:21 < jemfinch> yeah, it seems really cool.
11:28 < TheStar> What is a really cool database engine?
11:28 < Daverz> sqlite
11:29 < Daverz> claims be be 2 times faster than mysql and 5 times faster than pgsql, and my own benchmarks show that to be pretty reasonable
11:29 < TheStar> What about gadfly?
11:29 < TheStar> But, that's impressive...
11:29 < Daverz> cool, but much slower
11:30 < TheStar> Does it need a server?
11:30 < TheStar> I'm using gadfly at the moment - it's good enough (I'm only learning...
11:30 < Daverz> no, it's embedded.  single locked file
11:31 < TheStar> ?
11:31 < Daverz> sqlite uses a single locked file
11:31 < TheStar> Ok.
11:31 < TheStar> I have a class "database".  In that class is another class "student"
11:32 < TheStar> What's the best way to initialse that class (student) in the __init__ of database?
11:32  * thierry is back (gone 09:28:35)
11:32 < TheStar> Or, do I _have_ to continue using the following line:         db.student.add("Student_1")
11:33 < dash> TheStar: there's no reason to nest classes
11:33 < Daverz> what was wrong with db.student(), i.e. producing the object on request?
11:33 < TheStar> dash: Could you please suggest an alternative?
11:33 < dash> TheStar: Not nesting classes.
11:34 < TheStar> Umm...
11:34 < TheStar> Ok, WHY isn't there any reason to nest classes?
11:34 < thierry> morning
11:34 < dash> TheStar: because there is no advantage in it
11:34 < thierry> hello dash
11:35 < dash> thierry: hello
11:35 < TheStar> I'm confused - could you explain why?
11:35 < dash> TheStar: what's to explain? there is nothing at all to be gained by nesting classes
11:35 < TheStar> Daverz: I don't think there's anything 'wrong' with it...
11:35 < TheStar> dash: Organization - students are part of database...?
11:36 < dash> TheStar: yes. students are. the class Student is not.
11:36 < TheStar> ?
11:36 < Daverz> not very flexible, but it'll work in a pinch
11:36 < TheStar> ?
11:36 < dash> TheStar: Do you understand the difference between classes and instances?
11:36 < TheStar> No - could you educate me?
11:36 < TheStar> instances = objects?
11:37 < dash> TheStar: everything in python is an object
11:37 < TheStar> Hmm, good point...
11:37 < dash> TheStar: start here: http://ibiblio.org/obp/thinkCSpy/chap12.htm
11:37 < Daverz> what do you mean by nested classes?  you've actually got a class Student in your class DB block, Star?
11:37 < TheStar> dash: Ok, so, instead of db.student.add("name"), it would be better if it was db.add_student("name")?
11:37 < TheStar> Daverz: Yes.
11:38 < dash> TheStar: it might be. it all depends
11:38  * TheStar loads that link..
11:38 < dash> TheStar: you've told me virtually nothing about your requirements or your data structures,
11:38 < dash> and so it's not really possible for me to tell
11:39 < Daverz> TheStar: i can take a look at your code if you like: dave@davidcook.org
11:39 < TheStar> Nothing new in that link...
11:39 < dash> it'd be better if you'd post your code on a webserver so we all can see it
11:39 < TheStar> Hmm
11:39 < dash> TheStar: how did you learn python?
11:39 < TheStar> 1-week crash course, XP style, at a summer school, at uni.
11:40 < TheStar> Got me addicted ;)
11:40 < dash> TheStar: okay. well, first you need to grasp that there are virtually no similiarities between python and C++
11:40  * TheStar is still in high school.
11:40 < TheStar> dash: I used to think there were, but I no longer think there are, that is, beyond the fundamentals of the langauges concepts, eg, variables are...  funcitons are..., etc.
11:41 < dash> nope, variables and functions are very different as well
11:41 < TheStar> Sort of...
11:41 < TheStar> c++ is a heck alot more strict, but python, yes, it changes things...
11:41 < TheStar> ;)
11:41 < TheStar> I prefer python.
11:41 < dash> "strict" is a rather vague term
11:42 < TheStar> ;)
11:42 < dash> well, yes. there's no excuse for C++
11:42 < TheStar> It's fast...
11:42 < TheStar> But not as fast as asm...
11:42 < TheStar> ;)
11:42 < dash> languages do not have speeds; programs do
11:42 < TheStar> And yet, it's (sorta) object oriented...
11:42 < dash> no, it isn't
11:43 < pyn> <Yosomono@efnet> speeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed
11:43 < dash> c++ is class-oriented like simula
11:43 < TheStar> Like I said, (sorta) ;)
11:43 < dash> TheStar: if by "sorta" you mean "not at all", then sure
11:43 < TheStar> But, yes, Yosomono is right...
11:43 < TheStar> dash: it's more object oriented than C.
11:43 < pyn> <Yosomono@efnet> class != object
11:43 < dash> TheStar: no it isn't.
11:43 < pyn> <Yosomono@efnet> Go speedracer go!
11:44 < TheStar> Actually, C++ was originally C with classes...
11:44 -!- Ra1stlin [raistlin@pD9EA06A1.dip0.t-ipconnect.de] has joined #python
11:44 < TheStar> SO...  I guess... ;)
11:44 < pyn> <Yosomono@efnet> pffft object orientation is something that comes from the programmer, not the language
11:44 < Ra1stlin> good morning
11:44 < dash> yes
11:44 < dash> C++ has classes
11:44 < Daverz> what is this, comp.objects now?
11:44 < dash> i never disagreed with that :)
11:44 < TheStar> But it can be made to be object oriented - I'm getting outa my league here... ;)
11:44 < dash> Daverz: hello! welcome to #python
11:44 < TheStar> Daverz: No, comp.Daverz ;)
11:45 < TheStar> Daverz: No, comp.dash that is, ;)
11:45 < pyn> <Yosomono@efnet> comp.big.league
11:45 < TheStar> dash: It would confuse you if I showed you my source now, it's so, well, confusing... ;)
11:46 < pyn> <Yosomono@efnet> "Of course it's confusing, that's why it's called CODE!"
11:46 < TheStar> I originally thought that I should subclass because...
11:46 < dash> TheStar: i'm already confused
11:46 < dash> TheStar: you're not going to make it worse by priovding me with information :)
11:47 < TheStar> I would have a class "database", which would have a student, which would also be a class (subclass), and you'd perform different actions depending on what function.
11:47 < TheStar> And then, you could inherit that class in a new class for "teachers"?
11:47 < hendry> How would I nicely join a list of ints in puthon? ' '.join([12,34,56,78]) # expects a string?
11:47 < TheStar> dash: What's your email again?
11:47 -!- jemfinch [~jfincher@ts35-11.homenet.ohio-state.edu] has quit [Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)]
11:47 < hendry> TheStar: dear me
11:48 < dash> TheStar: you dont have access to a webserver?
11:48 < TheStar> hendry: Hmm, looping through the ints, and then adding it on the end of the list (via .append), I dunno, I'm newbie.
11:48 < TheStar> dash: Not yet...
11:48 < dash> hendry: ' '.join(map(str,my_list)
11:48 < dash> TheStar: cant run one locally?
11:49 < TheStar> dash: Behind firewall, Recently got a static IP though...
11:49 < TheStar> Going to get a domain name soon ;)
11:49 < TheStar> Then I'll install apache, etc...
11:49 < dash> bleh
11:49  * dash goes downstairs to look for cookies
11:50 < TheStar> dash: You've already given me your email address, no harm in giving it again...
11:51 < TheStar> Hmm
11:52 < dash> no i didn't.
11:53 < TheStar> Hmm.
11:53 < pyn> <Yosomono@efnet> dash: Cookies are your one weakness, aren't they?
11:53  * TheStar disables cookies by default...
11:53 < pyn> <Yosomono@efnet> hah
11:53 < TheStar> And even if I find them, I always use ssh
11:53 < TheStar> Preferably ssh2
11:53 < TheStar> Anyway...
11:54 < TheStar> I'm going to be storing the following information in the 'student' database:
11:54 < TheStar> reference to the timetable
11:54 < TheStar> group
11:54 < TheStar> subject(s)
11:54 < TheStar> details
11:54 < dash> yosomono: In the warmer months, popsicles are my other weakness.
11:54 < TheStar> class, etc....
11:54 < pyn> <Yosomono@efnet> dash: Aha!
11:54 < pyn> * Yosomono@efnet makes a note in his little notebook
11:55 < TheStar> Yosomono: You record other people's weaknesses?
11:55 < dash> but even more than that, LARGE AMOUNTS OF CASH are my weakness
11:55  * red_one throws pointers at dash
11:55 < pyn> <Yosomono@efnet> TheStar: But of course.
11:55  * dash makes them bounce off Superman-style.
11:55  * red_one throws xml at dash
11:56 < TheStar> dash: Should I make my 'student' a function, rather than a class, and make it have a query language?
11:56 < dash> fool! XML ONLY MAKES ME STRONGER NOW
11:56 < pyn> <Yosomono@efnet> 5 gigs of mp3s and I can't find anything I wanna listen to
11:56 < pyn> <Yosomono@efnet> o_O
11:56  * red_one throws javabeans at dash
11:56 < hendry> dash: http://db.cs.helsinki.fi/~hendry/faqwiz/faqw.py?req=recent
11:56 < dash> red_one: No such thing.
11:57 < TheStar> dash: So, in other words, I might as well work directly with gadfly?  Without my wrapper class?
11:57  * red_one douses dash in HTTP requests
11:57 < dash> TheStar: I'd start there.
11:57  * dash wields his pocket twisted.web
11:57 < TheStar> Hmm
11:57 < pyn> * Yosomono@efnet taunts red_one with his copy of Freeloader
11:57 < red_one> yosomono: FUCKER!
11:57 < pyn> <Yosomono@efnet> red_one: I can play multiregion gamecube games now!
11:57 < red_one> does it work?
11:57 < dash> hendry: yes. join is a little strange
11:57 < pyn> * Yosomono@efnet dances with glee
11:57 < red_one> well?
11:57 < pyn> <Yosomono@efnet> red_one: Yes.
11:58 < red_one> what's your cube->tv cable?
11:58 < pyn> <Yosomono@efnet> red_one: My coworker was playing the US version of Jedi Knight II last night.
11:58 < pyn> <Yosomono@efnet> red_one: um, whatever came in the box
11:58 < red_one> so just a red&yellow&white connector cable?
11:58 < pyn> <Yosomono@efnet> yep
11:58 < red_one> hm.
11:59 < pyn> <Yosomono@efnet> So I'll be playing Metroid Prime in ENGLISH tonight
11:59 < pyn> * Yosomono@efnet weeps
11:59 < red_one> bastard.
11:59 < red_one> you dirty dirty bastard.
11:59 < dotz> moin, bots.
11:59 < red_one> buy me one :P

12:03 < pyn> <Yosomono@efnet> red_one: The only difference between your cube and mine is one little switch.

12:09 < TheStar> I'm mirring the structure in gadfly at the moment - to make it easier for portability...
12:09 < TheStar> I've got "cursor" as a subclass of "timedb"
12:10 < TheStar> How do I get cursor to use self.connection as found in timedb?
12:10 < TheStar> Oops.
12:11 < TheStar> I've got cursor as a subclass of timedb, but in cursor, I have execute.

12:28 < TheStar> I've got cursor as a subclass of timedb, but in cursor, I have execute.
12:28 < TheStar> How do I get execute to use the self.connection object as found in timedb?
12:28 < Daverz> whazzat?
12:28 < Daverz> timedb?
12:28 < TheStar> It's a database I'm making, based on gadfly.
12:28 < TheStar> It's mainly a layer, so that I can easily switch to say, mysql.
12:29 < Daverz> are you using DB API 2.0?
12:29 < TheStar> Gadfly is apparently mainly compliant...
12:29 < TheStar> ODBC 2.0
12:29 < Daverz> you would do cur = connection.cursor(); cursor.execute("your sql")
12:30 < Daverz> then one of the cursor.fetch* methods if it's a select statement
12:30 < TheStar> I'm sorta mirroring the structure abit...
12:30 < TheStar> So, I'm going to have timedb.connection.cursor
12:33 < TheStar> Oops. timedb.cursor
12:33 < TheStar> But the gadfly object will be in timedb.
12:33 < TheStar> So, how would I get it to use that object?
12:35 < Daverz> why not just return a cursor object
12:35 < TheStar> Daverz: Yes, but, how?
12:35 < Daverz> def getCursor(self): return self.connection.cursor()
12:36 < TheStar> Thanks. ;)

13:00 < Leibo> hi all
13:00 < Leibo> How can I use diff with python w/o executing it?
13:00 < Leibo> has anyone made a module for this
13:00 < Leibo> %google python diff
13:00 < pyn> python diff: http://interscript.sourceforge.net/interscript/doc/en_util_0011.html
13:00 < Leibo> is good for nothing
13:01 < dash> Leibo: did you look in the standard library?
13:02 < Leibo> dash: where in the standard lib?
13:02 < dash> http://python.org/doc/lib/
13:02 < Leibo> python.org/doc/modules?
13:02 < Leibo> dash: there's a text oriented diff
13:03 < dash> as opposed to what other kind?
13:03 < Leibo> I know it but I want some standard diff files
13:03 < dash> so what's wrong with /usr/bin/diff?
13:03 < Leibo> executing anything hogs flow alot
13:04 < Leibo> I need quick cgi
13:04 < dash> no it doesn't
13:04 < dash> er
13:04 < dash> heh.
13:04 < Leibo> what did you 'er\n heh.' about?
13:04  * VladDrak sighs
13:04 < dash> so what's wrong with /usr/bin/diff?
13:04  * VladDrak still hasn't made up his mind about a python GUI
13:05 < Yhg1s> VladDrac: you could've written three different ones by now :)
13:05 < Yhg1s> Leibo: if you want standard diff files, use standard diff. that is the only guarantee you get standard diffs, because diffs aren't IETF standardized.
13:05 < VladDrak> well
13:05 < VladDrak> I've tried using Tkinter
13:06 < Leibo> VladDrak: wxPython.org rules the GUI eart
13:06 < VladDrak> but I don't like it - the widgets are too limited (i.e. listbox is single columned)
13:06 < VladDrak> leibo: I've heard as much good about wxPython as I've heard bad things
13:06 < Leibo> with wxPython you're having no limits whatsoever
13:06 < Yhg1s> VladDrak: there are3rd-party widgets out there too.
13:06 < Leibo> which bad things have you heard?
13:06 < VladDrak> tix you mean?
13:06 < Yhg1s> VladDrak: in case you're wondering
13:06 < Yhg1s> no, PMW
13:07 < Leibo> VladDrak: try anygui if you want something portable
13:07 < Yhg1s> it supposedly adds a ton of useful widgets
13:07 < VladDrak> well
13:07 < Yhg1s> Leibo: you're kidding, right ?
13:07 < VladDrak> I need somethign portable
13:07 < Yhg1s> Leibo: he already said tkinter was too limited :)
13:07 < VladDrak> but anygui is not the way
13:07 < VladDrak> heh :)
13:07 < Leibo> Yhg1s: true true
13:07 < VladDrak> anyway, runnign smoothly under windows is a requirement as well
13:07 < VladDrak> so I think it's either Tikinter or wxPython
13:08 < Yhg1s> most GUI toolkits for Python are portable across Unix and Wintendows, and many across MacOS too.
13:08 < Leibo> I can see nothing wring with wxPyton - check out the demo you'll be impressed
13:08 < dash> there are things wrong with wxpython
13:08 < dash> like, it crashes
13:08 < Yhg1s> VladDrak: PyQT is portable too, I believe.
13:08 < Yhg1s> dash :)
13:09 < Yhg1s> I was just going to explain that I've seen numerous crashes with wxPython, and I don't even use it.
13:09 < Yhg1s> VladDrak: GLUT is also portable >:-)
13:09 < Yhg1s> but you'll need to draw most of your widgets yourself. :)
13:09 < Leibo> Yhg1s: BTW another withdraw with /usr/bin/diff is that you can't use it on a string in the memory but have to save to a file before
13:09 < Yhg1s> Leibo: you can use it on a string in memory (just pass it as stdin) but you can't use it on *two* strings in memory :)
13:10 < VladDrak> yhgis: but not free under windows right?
13:10 < Yhg1s> VladDrak: I seem to recall that PyQT is free under windows, as they ( = PyQT) provide a binary package
13:10 < Yhg1s> but I may be mistaken
13:11 < Leibo> the Qt implementation in windows contains many BiDi bugs :(
13:11 < Leibo> Yhg1s: are you quit sure it'll be as fast as native python?
13:11 < Yhg1s> Leibo: what, diff ?
13:11 < Yhg1s> Leibo: it won't come close to native python speed; it will be much faster.
13:12 < psy> l
13:12 < Yhg1s> diff is quite a complicated algorithm, and any python implementation will be many times slower than the C implementation of diff. Also much more readable and maintainable, mind you :)
13:12 < VladDrak> hmm ok
13:13 < VladDrak> so it boils down to tkinter, wx and qt
13:15 < deltab> have you seen difflib ?
13:16 < VladDrak> yhgis: qt isn't free under windows, afaik
13:16 < Yhg1s> Binary packages of PyQt are provided for the non-commercial version of Qt for Windows, and for the Sharp Zaurus.
13:16 < Yhg1s> depends on what you want to use it for, I guess.
13:19 < Leibo> Yhg1s: do you know the differ std. lib.?

15:22 < rik> is there a nice interface for the pipe/fork/exec combo?
15:22 < rik> Lewis: wassat then?
15:22 < Lewis> other than not having list.join()
15:22 < Lewis> ad that's the fact all the standard modules are in a single namespace
15:22 < Lewis> +n
15:23 < Lewis> we have socket, rather than net.socket
15:23  * rik nod
15:24 < Lewis> also, what do you mean by nice interface?
15:24 < Erwin> meh. xml has its own namespace
15:24 < Lewis> why not popen2, os.fork, etc?
15:24 < Erwin> rik: popen, popen2, popen3
15:24 < rik> Lewis: i was checking whether there was a more pleasant interface, that's all.
15:24  * rik goes for popen3
15:25 < Lewis> Popen4 is better
15:25 < Lewis> nicer, at least
15:26 < Lewis> and more portable, since os.wait is unix only, but Popenobject.wait() is
15:26 < Lewis> *isn't

17:55 < jemfinch> what's the problem?
17:55 < ameoba_> jemfinch : what does 2.2 do?  Is it mentioned in the changelogs?
17:55 < jemfinch> ameoba_: 2.2 doesn't allow multi-character strings in that construct.
17:56 < jemfinch> ameoba_: so it obviously uses the only search possible for a character in a string.
17:56 < rik> hm. i want to take a list of strings, prefix them all with "  " and then join them with \n's, simply.
17:57 < jemfinch> '\n'.join(["  " + s for s in L])

18:20 < reycode> oops..
18:20 < reycode> uhm ..
18:20 < jemfinch> reycode: we can't try to help you if you don't tell us what the problem actually is.
18:21 < reycode> i run the server.py which waits for a request in an infinite loop
18:21 < reycode> and then i run the client.py which sends some message (hello network world or smth.) to the server, which should echo this message
18:21 < reycode> buut, i get two different errors..

18:23 < jemfinch> you should ask before pasting so much code.
18:23 < reycode> since i typed in exactly what was in the python book, and since i am new to socket-operations, i have no idea how to fix it
18:23 < reycode> sorry
18:23 < jemfinch> it's fine.
18:23 < jemfinch> ok, you need to wait longer between running the program.
18:23 < polux> z3p: doesn't work....canvas instance has no __call__ methode :(
18:23 < jemfinch> and make sure you're not already running an instance of it.
18:23 < reycode> thats the only thing??
18:24 < jemfinch> or, you need to set the option to reuse the address, which I can't remember off the top of my head right now.
18:24 < reycode> i f i run it, i get the first error, so i run it again, then the second error raises, then the first...
18:24 < jemfinch> and you can't send on a socket that's not connected, so there's a bug there too.  Perhaps you're sending to the wrong socket on accident?

20:25 < GilbertBSD> in bash, you can say $*
20:25 < GilbertBSD> can you say the same thing in python ?
20:25 < GilbertBSD> or something similar?
20:25 < Tenshihan|work> GilbertBSD: perhaps if you explained what it did

20:25 < Tenshihan|work> stdin?
20:25 < GilbertBSD> yes.

20:26 < john_> $* is command line arguments.
20:26 < drewp> GilbertBSD: use optparse
20:26 < drewp> GilbertBSD: or you can look at sys.argv
20:26 < GilbertBSD> okay. if you have 1 watch, you know exactly what time it is. if you have 3 watches you get confused!!!

21:33 < grib> the way I'm using them is to test for changes to an object since it was loaded from a data store... so memory[obj] = deepcopy(obj), then when I check for updates I just compare obj to memory[obj]

23:07 < dash> DarkStorm: if you keep a reference to it you need to incref it, yes
23:07 < xen> dash: because zip or map is gonna iterate over teh lists before the loop begins?
23:07 < dash> xen: yes
23:08 < DarkStorm> dash: currently i'm doing that but it's crashing rarely. could that be caused by me inrecfing all the contents of the list too ? (iterating trough it and increfing everything)
23:08 < dash> xen: in the grand scheme of things it's probably insignificant
23:08 < dash> DarkStorm: dont do that.
23:08 < dash> DarkStorm: go read the python manual's section on reference counting again

23:10 < dash> xen: well the first rule of optimization is "dont optimize"
23:10 < xen> dash: how so?
23:10 < dash> DarkStorm: objects are only deallocated when their reference counts falls to zero
23:11 < SamB> xen: because you should only optimize at such time as 2nd or higher numbered rules come in to play
23:11 < dash> xen: the second rule is for experts only
23:11 < dash> it's "dont optimize yet"
23:12 < xen> is this written somewhere?
23:12 < SamB> if you don't optimize, you leave much more chance of being able to actually optimize when you really need it, right?

23:16 < ThomasWaldmann> does sb know WHEN python does garbage collection?
23:17 < xen> wed nights, leave it by the curb
23:17 < Erwin> ThomasWaldmann: that depends on numbers shown in gc.get_thresholds()
23:17 < xen> sorry
23:17 < Erwin> ThomasWaldmann: the first number is number of allocation between the garbage collector considering to run -- see the gc module docs for a detailed explanation
23:18 < ThomasWaldmann> yes, but when does it check that?

23:19 < ThomasWaldmann> because we have some probs with rs232 i/o
23:19 < ThomasWaldmann> somewhat time critical stuff
23:19 < SamB> ThomasWaldmann: you may turn it off
23:19 < PerlJam> ThomasWaldmann: And how does it make sense to twiddle with the GC?
23:20 < SamB> import gc; gc.disable()
23:20 < ThomasWaldmann> ok, will turn it off. the point is that it should do gc in time critical sections.
23:20 < SamB> later you could do gc.collect()
23:20 < PerlJam> And how time critical are we talking about here?  It can't be that critical if you're using a language like python to talk to the serial port
23:20 < ThomasWaldmann> shouldnt of course ;)
23:20 < SamB> or gc.enable()
23:20 < exarkun> PerlJam: why not?
23:21 < ThomasWaldmann> PerlJam: not too critical i thought. only 9600 or 19200 bps.
23:21 < PerlJam> exarkun: It might be a failure of imagination on my part, but I always do serial I/O things and the garbage collector doesn't ever get in the way
23:21 < ThomasWaldmann> shouldnt pose a major problem to an athlon 1700+, but we had lost chars sometimes and sometimes couldnt cope with data coming in.
23:22 < PerlJam> ThomasWaldmann: I'd look other places than python to find out why those characters are lost and it couldn't cope.
23:22 < PerlJam> for instance, are you using flow control?
23:23 < SamB> turning off gc won't cause problems for short periods if you don't create lots of circular structures and destroy them again
23:23 < ThomasWaldmann> PerlJam: flowcontrol is not possible. no hardware.
23:23 < ThomasWaldmann> but we have fifos, 16c550 type.
23:23 < SamB> err, forget, not destroy
23:23 < ThomasWaldmann> SamB: we only put the received data into a list

23:30 < raowork> well i was hoping that someone new would know
23:30 < PerlJam> ThomasWaldmann: You might want to check that you aren't accidentally sharing an IRQ or memory space.
23:31 < ThomasWaldmann> PerlJam: we did it on ttyS0 / S1 - no sharing no conflicts

14:49 < Yhg1s> kinema: use the 'htmllib' or 'sgmllib' modules.
14:49 < Yhg1s> don't use b)
14:49 < Yhg1s> especially when it's someone else's HTML

14:49 < stranger> Yhg1s: parsing might well be overkill
14:49 < Yhg1s> it might work if you have very, very strict rules.
14:49 < Yhg1s> kinema: yes, use htmllib (or sgmllib directly)
14:50 < kinema> thank you very much

15:52 < Yhg1s> boomah: a table of 'criterium -> function' where you call the appropriate function based on the criterium. If you have to do regexps you need to implement it as a list of 2-tuples (regex-object, functoin), but often you can use a simple dict-lookup instead (say, strings.)
15:52 < Yhg1s> for instance:
15:53 < boomah> oh

15:53 < Yhg1s> [ (re.compile("foo"), foo_func), (re.compile("bar"), bar_func)]

23:23 < jonez> it runs as root so that it can bind to port 22.
23:23 < merc> exarkun: is the pynfo bot setup to take commands from chat, or is there a plugin i have to get?
23:23 < drewp> keychain is a cache layer beyond ssh-agent which gives you even more  (controlled) passwordlessness, but unlike using empty passphrases, you dont have open keys sitting on disk
23:23 < SamB> if ssh doesn't run suid root, then isn't it dangerous for it to be able to get your passphrase whenever it likes?

23:38 < MoonFallen> oh, rmb=right mouse button
23:38 < radix> scp uses the shell to glob on the remote end, too
23:38 < radix> you have to be careful with escaping, though

23:39 < drewp> radix: oh yeah, i guess it is my shell
23:39 < MoonFallen> bluszcz: yes. xgettext on your source files will produce a file called whatever.pot.  take that file and copy it into /home/bluszcz/locale/pl_PL/LC_MESSAGES end en/LC_MESSAGES

23:40 < MoonFallen> bluszcz: then translate in that file, and run msgfmt, now you have a data file that gettext can read

23:42 < MoonFallen> in fact, now i have to figure out how to make gettext work in 2 languages simultaneously

13:45 < dash> tell us about it
13:46 < Tangent> OK... I'm pondering the temperature control for my office... I've got 4 fans and an aircon unit to consider... and 5 temperature sensors scattered around.
13:46 < Tangent> We measure the outside temperature, three places in the machine room, and one in the office
13:46 -!- TTimo is now known as TTimoAFK
13:47 < Tangent> Sometimes we'll want to cool the servers with fresh air.. other times with aircon... sometimes same for the office.. other times now...
13:47 < Tangent> Just been trying to work it all out on paper, and I think I'm gonna end up with 8 billion if statements
13:48 < Tangent> There's so many conditions.... if it's cold out, and cold in the office... we want to direct the heat from the server room into the office...
13:49 < Tangent> Or if it's hot outside, hot servers and hot office, we want to turn on the aircon and cool the servers and the office...
13:49 < Tangent> etc etc etc
13:49 < fatjim> you could use a state machine
13:49 < Tangent> fatjim: That sounds like what I need
13:49 < fatjim> (if you have a clear idea how things should work, which it sounds like you are developing)
13:50 < Tangent> The problem's with the clear idea I think
13:50 < fatjim> ah
13:50 < fatjim> well, "KISS" as always
13:50 < Tangent> Yeah.. it's simple right now... and it works... but it won't work in the summer... because it assumes that it's always colder outside than inside right now

13:53 < Tangent> Just to add to the fun, the fans aren't digital either.... there's 128 different power levels
13:53 < dash> Tangent: well, list all the possible _output_ states first, if that's smaller :)
13:54 < fatjim> i think "too hot" "too cold" and "good enough" would be good starts :)

14:49 < Yhg1s> k_at_303_dot_nu: random.random() returns something in the range [0.0, 1.0), so eight times that is still likely to be below 0.5, which rounds to 0.
14:50 < Yhg1s> so it's possible you got 0 when you tried it a few times.
14:50 < k_at_303_dot_nu> Yhg1s: that's why I multiply by 8!

14:57 < Yhg1s> k_at_303_dot_nu: something is very very wrong with your python... 'int(9.1)' should in no way give an overflow error. Where/how did you install python ?
14:58 < Yhg1s> as for your .pystartup... just start python with -E

14:59 < k_at_303_dot_nu> Yhg1s: gentoo emerge...
14:59 < k_at_303_dot_nu> fatjim: so no cvs...
14:59 < Yhg1s> file a bug with the gentoo/emerge (whatever that is) package manager then :)
15:00 < deltab> what happens with int(9)?
15:00 < Yhg1s> or perhaps it's a libc bug (more likely, since int() doesn't really do much.)
15:00 < Yhg1s> or an optimizer bug
15:00 < k_at_303_dot_nu> deltab: 9, that works...
15:00 < Yhg1s> (as in, C optimizer)
15:01 < dash> if you're using gentoo, it's probably gentoo's fault
15:01 < dash> we've seen this sort of thing here before with gento users, IIRC
15:02 < k_at_303_dot_nu> dash: ok... so much for gentoo then... :/

15:03 < k_at_303_dot_nu> dash: ok... I'll be rebooting into my debian again...
15:04 < k_at_303_dot_nu> but I still wonder why I was banned from this channel... especially when seeing some people making ruder remarks than I ever did on irc...
15:04 < fatjim> often, gentoo is actualy exposing extremely subtle bugs in either gcc's processor-specific optimizing, or in the code itself
15:04 < Yhg1s> but not in the case of Python!
15:04 < Yhg1s> :-)
15:04 < dash> you were banned because your link was flaky and your quit/joins were spamming the channel, is all
15:05 < dash> and i forgot to remove it later
15:05 < dash> as i said, sorry for the inconvenience
15:05 < fatjim> the gimp developers railed against gentoo and gcc extreme-optimization settings for a while
15:05 < k_at_303_dot_nu> dash: ah, ok! my dsl connection is pretty flaky...
15:05 < fatjim> until someone noticed a very, very subtle bug in a gimp data structure
15:05 < fatjim> but, i still blame gentoo for this :)

15:07 < Yhg1s> How does that name-dialing stuff in 'merica work ? What actual *number* is 1-800-EXPEDIA ? :)
15:07 < Nemerid> I would like to apply a function in a module which name has been get with argv
15:07 < fatjim> Yhg1s: there are letters on the buttons on the phone
15:08 < Yhg1s> fatjim: yes, but I'm not an american, and neither is my phone.
15:08 < fatjim> ah
15:08 < Nemerid> But I can't give a str to apply, is someone has an idea ?
15:08 < nbm> Yhg1s: 1-800-3973342
15:08 < fatjim> Yhg1s: oh :) i thought that was a for-instance
15:08 < Yhg1s> thanx

15:08 < dash> q and z got left out
15:08 < Nemerid> Is somebody understand my problem ?
15:09 < deltab> Nemerid: you need to get the function object, using getattr or the like
15:09 < Yhg1s> Nemerid: yes, we understand your problem,
15:09 < nbm> q is on 7 and z is on 9 on my cellphone
15:09 < fatjim> Nemerid: i don't, why don't you show us the code you are trying to use?
15:09 < fatjim> (a short example)

15:12 < Nemerid> I would like to if somone has a tip to do what I want ?
15:12 < Nemerid> (to know)
15:13 < deltab> like I said, you need the function object
15:13 < Nemerid> Yhg1s: have you got a solution to my problem since you understand it ;)
15:13 < Nemerid> deltab: could you give me an exemple ?
15:14 < Yhg1s> Nemerid: what deltab is saying. You need to translate the name to a function object (or method object, or other callable object) by use of, for instance, getattr().
15:14 < deltab> getattr(m, s)()
15:15 < Nemerid> Yhg1s: deltab : thanks a lot
15:15 < Yhg1s> Nemerid: if the function is really a function in another module, you can use 'import module; func = getattr(module, sys.argv[1]); func()', or if it has to be in your current module, you can use 'globals()[sys.argv[1]]' to get the function.
15:15 < Nemerid> Yhg1s: very nice !

17:43 < kingsley> Does anyone happen to know where the "Gnumeric" module for python is?
17:44 < deltab> as in the spreadsheet?
17:44 < Erwin> maybe you are thinking of Numeric aka NumArray
17:44 < frb> or Numpy
17:44 < kingsley> deltab: Yes, that's right.
17:45 < hendry> In a program, how do I see the chars of a string like I would see them in a interactive python session?
17:45 < frb> but actually, I believe gnumeric comes with some python bindings in its own source
17:45 < deltab> hendry: print repr(s)
17:45 < hendry> deltab: thanks
17:46 < deltab> http://grub.ath.cx/gnumeric-python/
17:46 < kingsley> frb: Yes, gnumeric does come with some python code, and it happens to try to import everything from the Gnumeric module. Here's the big but. It can't find the Gnumeric module.
17:46 < hendry> isn't strip() supposed to remove trailing '\n'?
17:46 < Erwin> hendry: strip removes all whitespace on both sides of the string -- and RETURNS the new string
17:47 < hendry> if not, how should I remove trailing '\n' from a string?
17:47 < frb> kingsley: oh, then google is your friend, and so is deltab, who probably used google
17:47 < Kengur> hendry: re
17:48 < hendry> Kengur: oh please not re
17:48 < kingsley> deltab: Yes, I was following the instructions in that URL when I realized that the Gnumeric module isn't installed.
17:49 < kingsley> frb: Yes again, I found the URL with Google.
17:49 < deltab> kingsley: are you running the code from inside Gnumeric?
17:49 < Kengur> hendry: we are the knights who say 'Ni!'
17:50 < kemu> weet soms iemand waar ge kunt vertalen van engels naar nederlands ?
17:50 < kemu> wrong chan :s
17:50 < hendry> I figured : file = filename.split()[0] # but it looks ugle
17:51 < kingsley> deltab: I'm happy to report that I can successfully run python plugins from withing gnumeric. The problem is when the plugin tries to access a function in gnumeric's API, like "sqrt".

17:40 < mechanix> I am converting a tuple into one string as such: ', '.join(["'%s'"] * 4) % (tuple (row[3:7]))     However when some of the elements are empty this results in  '', ''  etc; instead I'd like to put " null, null " etc. there. Can that still be done within that join() or do I have to check & add each element separately?

17:52 < icct> ppl, how to get reference to gtk+ object from glade2 constructed UI?
17:52 < bradb> i think half of the people that write to webmaster@python.org are bound to end up on jerry springer one day
17:53 < scroll> I have a CGI app that sets os.environ['FROM_HEADER'] and then runs the system "mail" command, which supposedly uses that environment variable, but it is not using my value. Am I confused about *which* environment I am setting or something?
17:54 < mechanix> pbi: thanks, that's it - and has the nice side effect of not having to hardcode lengths in my code as I did before :-)
17:55 < scroll> I am using os.popen2 to write to the "mail" command -- will this honor the env I set with os.environ?
17:55 < pbi> mechanix: maybe "'%s'"%x should be replaced by repr(x) if it is to be displayed.
17:56 < mechanix> hmm? no, it's buildup of an SQL query
17:57 < mechanix> icct: check http://www.daa.com.au/~james/software/libglade/, it has an example
17:57 < pbi> mechanix: ah. what about sql injection ?

11:54 < kriptik> Barghest my python interpreter does not behave in that manner
11:55 < pyn> <Xaer@efnet> I have a lot of files: I want to build an index of what date, size etc that file has, and what keywords...
11:56 < ameoba> you probably want to represent the individual files as dicts or objects (depending on how complex you want this to be).
11:57 < pyn> <Xaer@efnet> like [2003 03 25, 250, blah, blah] = what a nice little file
11:57 < ameoba> The keyword thing would probably be best done as a dictionary using keywords as keys and holding lists of files.
11:57 < kriptik> Barghest what version of python?
11:58 < ameoba> kriptik : more likely an OS dependant thing...
11:58 < pyn> <Xaer@efnet> I need it to be as fast as possible. What is the fastest dtastructure
11:58 < pyn> <Xaer@efnet> ?
11:58 < pyn> <Barghest@efnet> Xaer > 2.2.2
11:59 < pyn> <Xaer@efnet> ?
11:59 < kriptik> Barghest what OS?
12:00 < ameoba> xaer : 'fast' for doing what?  A list can be faster than a dict, but not if you're doing linear searches every time you use it.
12:00 < ameoba> xaer : {'word1':[file1,f2,f3], word2:[f3,f2,f5]... } is about as good as you'll get.

21:25 < psy> generally you want to check neither, and simply try: opening it
21:25 < TTimo> TypeError: coercing to Unicode: need string or buffer, instance found
21:25 < TTimo> I'm getting this when I try to use it
21:25 < bitmonk> do you want to take unrelated action based on the existence of the file, or do you want to read from / write to the file?
21:26 < TTimo> ah nm, it's a different problem
21:27 < harobed> in python I can't do it : import "../foo.py" ?
21:27 < bitmonk> harobed try this:
21:27 < bitmonk> import sys
21:27 < bitmonk> sys.path.extend('..')
21:27 < bitmonk> import foo
21:28 < psy> sys.path.append :) extend will treat '..' as a sequence
21:28 < harobed> It doesn't exist one other solution ?
21:28 < bitmonk> oh yeh.. whatever..
21:28 < psy> harobed: or use the PYTHONPATH environment variable
21:28 < bitmonk> it's a sunday
21:28 < bitmonk> yeh..
21:28 < psy> monday!
21:28 < psy> hehe
21:28 < bitmonk> psy : that would be even worse ;p
21:28 < harobed> in C is more simple : include "../foo.h"; :)
21:28 < psy> it is :)
21:29 < bitmonk> harobed ; yes, but you aren't dealing with logical 'modules' in c/c++, you're dealing specifically with files
21:29 < bitmonk> there is a difference there..
21:30 < harobed> I can't say the file than I want use ?
21:30 < harobed> well, I'll use sys.path solution ...
21:31 < bitmonk> you could also export PYTHONPATH='../' and not worry about it in the python file, but the sys.path solution is better for portability or environments where you can't set pythonpath yourself..
21:31 < bitmonk> or you dont want to expect your users to export the pythonpath
21:37 < bitmonk> fwiw, python docs say not to include <python2.2/Python.h>, better to specify the compiler's include path..
21:38 < harobed> bitmonk: It don't work, Traceback (most recent call last):
21:38 < harobed>   File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?

16:57 < hendry> Could you please remind me too the typical technique of find the key of a value in a dict? (Guess you need to check if value exists)
16:58 < pyn_> <princepsd@ircnet> .has_key(key)
16:58 < pyn_> <princepsd@ircnet> ahh?
16:58 < pyn_> <princepsd@ircnet> to find the key of a value in a dict?
16:58 < pyn_> <princepsd@ircnet> well? it can be anything?
16:58 < pyn_> <princepsd@ircnet> it can be "many"
16:58 < deltab> dicts work the other way round
16:59 < deltab> you give a key and get the value
16:59 < hendry> yes, that is what i want
16:59 < deltab> d[k]
16:59 < hendry> I want to switch my dictionary the other way around
16:59 < pyn_> <princepsd@ircnet> use filter

17:10 < pbi> not because of the double way, but because of the per-packet data transmission

17:12 -!- winjer [~winjer@217.204.76.171] has joined #python
17:13 < itamar> pbi: if it's not in python, maybe ask Tv to add it to http://twistedmatrix.com/~tv/eunuchs/
17:13 < alb> pbi: udp sockets?
17:14 < pbi> dgram sockets
17:14 < alb> well yeah udp are dgram over ip =)
17:15 < pbi> yeah, but I won't work over IP for inter process communication :)
17:15 < alb> they're reliable over localhost, and preserve boundaries
17:15 < alb> why not?
17:15 < alb> performance over localhost is quite good
17:16 < pbi> unix sockets may be closer to what socketpair do than UDP on loopback
17:16 < alb> unless you are going waaay too much ipc
17:16 < alb> yeah they are another option
17:16 < itamar> pbi: as I said, ask Tv if he'll add it
17:16 < pbi> anyway, using loopbakc is really not an option because this traffic is sniffed traffic...
17:16 < alb> but dgram unix sockets are not bidirectional, you need two of them
17:16 < pbi> ok
17:16 < itamar> pbi: hopefully stuff in eunuchs will eventually merge with python
17:16 < alb> also, if you are working under python you really won't be able to see much difference in performance
17:17 < pbi> as the traffic in this socket comes from network (even loopback), I can't use network to have it transit.
17:18 < alb> i see..
17:18 < itamar> pbi: can
17:18 < itamar> can't have two sockets at once?
17:18 < pbi> only one direction is ok
17:18 < alb> then use unix dgram sockets and be happy =)
17:19 < pbi> yeah, I know but socketpair was exactly what I need.

18:31 < pyn> <princepsd@ircnet> might be a start ;))
18:31 < pyn> <some_geek@efnet> Then call .read() on what it returns, it'll block until there is data, or return if 'tail' exits.
18:32 < eugene> what if i don't go through a file (server-> stdout -> my python program)
18:33 < snibril> make a fifo and add a custolog directive to httpd.conf

18:50 < pyn> <some_geek@efnet> eugene: Sorry, I didn't understand that.  Can you repeat?
18:51 < pyn> <some_geek@efnet> Conan|: Short answer: No.  You'd need a carefully built firewall to use "only spare bandwidth".  Once that's in place, any decent ftp client can manage the rest of the requirements.
18:53 < pyn> <Conan|@efnet> some_geek: how do programs that sit in my taskbar, like www.backweb.com do it? it only downloads the content when there is spare bandwidth?
18:53 < eugene> python cookbook code works while using popen(tail -f) dont..(maybe i didn't write it correctly) .. by the way, can i do the samething without going through a file(server->stdout | myprogram)
18:53 < pyn> <some_geek@efnet> Well, I'll bet they lie.
18:54 < pyn> <some_geek@efnet> That makes it easier.  Probably, they are merely limiting bandwidth consumption to some fixed amount.

18:55 < pyn> <some_geek@efnet> I'm just checking it out, I guess they could sample how busy your NIC is, but without something that understands and can sample your WAN connection is involved, it's a "pipe dream", ha-hah.
18:56 < pyn> <Conan|@efnet> some_geek: yeah I was wondering how it worked - I think they just monitor packet calls and switch it on when there is little network use and switch it off when there is lots.
18:56 < pyn> <Conan|@efnet> some_geek: yeah how would they know what your max bandwidth is and to limit it at that level.
18:56 < pyn> <some_geek@efnet> But that won't work if you are on a switch.
18:56 < pyn> <Conan|@efnet> some_geek: I bet they just monitor useage and switch on on and off between useage periods.
18:56 < pyn> <Conan|@efnet> some_geek: it wouldn't?
18:57 < pyn> <some_geek@efnet> You won't see enough of the network traffic to accurately determine how busy your WAN links are, you are seeing only your very own traffic when you're plugged into a switch.
18:57 < pyn> <some_geek@efnet> Maybe they could watch the latency...  If it spikes, assume the network is busy and back off.

18:58 < pyn> <Conan|@efnet> right. but you can still monitor packets going out from your machine - if they are higher than a few kb/s then switch off otherwise switch on - ie no true throttling, just on and off, if the NIC isn't being used.

19:00 < itamar> but backweb started out long ago making a "push" browser

19:29 < itamar> well, that goes beyond my knowledge

20:46 < PenguinOfDoom> itamar: I want a generator-based reactor :(
20:46 < PenguinOfDoom> itamar: Except that it's not really a reactor, because it can't yield on behalf of the caller.
20:47 < itamar> huh?

20:47 < exarkun> or reactors

20:48 < PenguinOfDoom> Suppose you have user code in generators.

20:48 < PenguinOfDoom> So you want to issue a reactor.callLater

20:49 < itamar> huh?
20:49 < itamar> what's it have to do with the reactor?

21:36 < pyn> <Merlinus@ircnet> I don't know how it was possible...
21:36 < radix> merlinus: it's quite decidedly possible
21:40 < pyn> <Merlinus@ircnet> And one more question - is python 2.1 completely obsolete? Is it recommended to use 2.2?
21:40 < deltab> no, and yes
21:41 < radix> Use 2.2 or we'll beat you

21:42 < lament> *and
21:42 < radix> well, yes, 2.1 is completely obsolete
21:42 < lament> And hatred of C++
21:42 < radix> "obsolete" doesn't mean "unused", though
21:44 < deltab> adj 1: old; no longer in use or valid or fashionable;
21:44 < deltab> 1. No longer in use; gone into disuse; disused; neglected;
21:44 < radix> bah
21:45 < radix> not all definitions are correct ;)
21:45 < deltab> those ones are :-P
21:45 < radix> I mean the definition "totally replaceable by something else"
21:47 < damouse|> http://www.ibiblio.org/obp/thinkCSpy/chap03.htm
21:47 < pyn> <Merlinus@ircnet> OK, thanks for explanation.
21:47 < damouse|> that can be improved
21:47 < damouse|> the newLine part is just one print
21:47 < radix> damouse|: the author still maintains it, email him
21:47 < damouse|> but using up three newLine()'s for threeLines is wasteful of characters as it could be three prints making the code smaller
21:47 < exarkun> damouse|: No.
21:48 < exarkun> damouse|: The goal of programming is not to use as little disk space as possible.
21:48 < damouse|> exarkun: I know
21:48 < damouse|> but instead of making extra functions to do these things
21:49 < exarkun> damouse|: Keep reading.
21:49 < damouse|> which must be a waste of good memory and cpu
21:49 < damouse|> exarkun: I will
21:50  * damouse| still see's little point in doing it for a coupla newlines
21:50 < pyn> damouse|@ircnet has parted
21:51 < radix> damouse|: for a contrived example :)
21:51 < exarkun> damouse|: It's called abstraction
21:51 < exarkun> damouse|: Maybe next tuesday your display mechanism will change completely
21:51 < exarkun> damouse|: And you'll have to replace every "print" in your program with something else
21:51 < exarkun> damouse|: If you have a newLine abstraction, you only have to change 1 line of code
21:51 < exarkun> damouse|: If you don't, you have to change a crapload.
21:52 < damouse|> exarkun: hmmm, I see your point now
21:52  * damouse| see's why they put this channel here
21:52 < radix> Yes! To crush your ill-conceived illusions about programming ruthlessly and with extreme prejudice
21:53 < damouse|> radix: I was thinking more of the 'to help you understand the real concept'
21:53 < radix> damouse|: That'll do
21:54 < lament> but crushing is more fun than helping

22:10 < youssefsan> is there something like IDLE, unicode compatible ?
22:11 < pyn> <Nemes@efnet> beats me, your obviously 1 class up on the n00b to semi pro ladder than me
22:11 < pyn> <Nemes@efnet> lol i have noclue about unicode what so ever

22:12 < Hyperi> Nemes, Just that people in *here* like to ask it all the time ;) Hyperi refers to 'Hyper-active' ;)

22:18 < radix> yes

22:18 < radix> you might accidentally have two of the same module loaded into memory, one named "foo" and the other named "Kiwi.foo"

22:52 < radix> Hyperi: Note the `group' method
22:52 < Yhg1s> Hyperi: you can use a regexp for that, yes. read the 're' module documentation. You pass that string to re.compile (but make it a 'raw' string, using r"", so that the backslashes don't need escaping) and then call the .search() or .match() methods on the resulting regexp object, and those methods return 'match' objects that have a .group() and .groups() method which you can use to get the data from parenthesized expressions in your regexp.

00:07 < radix> I'm not sure, now, if he really means "processes"
00:07 < exarkun> crypt0: Just to clarify for the non-psychic in the audience today, you didn't mean "processes" as in different instances of the program, right?
00:08 < exarkun> crypt0: Only as in different things your program is doing?
00:08 < crypt0> radix: yes... I mean processes... because threads are evil...
00:08 < radix> crypt0: Ok, then you're terribly confused :)
00:08 < radix> like I said, processes don't share any memory, by default
00:09 < radix> It's not exactly easy to get them to do so, either. you probably want to use something like unix domain sockets to communicate between them
00:10 < radix> and, preferably, a remote-object system like Twisted's Perspective Broker to do the communication :)
00:10 < crypt0> radix: I know that processes don share memory... I think I am not that dumb... I am using pipes and shelve with temporary files to communicate between them...
00:11 < radix> crypt0: You should have said that earlier, it's very important :)
00:11 < Yhg1s> crypt0: we can't tell how dumb you are, this is IRC, everyone seems equally dumb.

00:11 < radix> Everyone is assumed dumb until proven smart
00:11 < Aether> Yhg1s: that's not really true
00:11 < Yhg1s> crypt0: but if you're at that level, you should really use something like Twisted's Prospective Broker.
00:11 < crypt0> yes... sorry... sometimes I forgot that the usual behavior here is "everyone is dumb, unless proved anything else"..
00:12 < radix> crypt0: Well, that's irrelevant

00:12 < Yhg1s> crypt0: 'better safe than sorry'. A smart person, when given a dumb-person-response, will repsond that he isn't dumb, and clarify his question.

17:27 < nevyn> is there any way to destroy variables ?
17:27 < radix> `del var', but that's pointless
17:27 < polux> crypt0: I always get a segmentation fault in the messages that use it
17:28 < crypt0> polux: you have a problema...
17:28 < nevyn> radix: why?
17:28 < radix> deleting attributes and indices can be useful, though
17:28 < radix> nevyn: Because it doesn't do anything that would already be done automatically
17:28 < polux> crypt0: I've tried to remove --purge but it doesn't work better
17:28 < radix> it's only really useful to delete attributes and indices, since those are persistent
17:28 < crypt0> nevyn: python automatically deletes your objects when there's no more references to them...
17:29 < kilobug> radix: forcing destruction at a specific can be usefull if you have destructors, or doesn't del force instant destrcution ?
17:29 < radix> crypt0: Well, we're talking about variables, not objects
17:29 < polux> crypt0: what does segmentation fault mean for python ?

19:30 < Erwin> How do you store your objects?
19:30 < ironfroggy> loading all the objects each request and checking them all is unaccetable
19:31 < ironfroggy> Erwin: i havent decided yet. that might depend on which will let me search them the fastest
19:31 < Erwin> SQL database, multiple indices.
19:32 < ironfroggy> whats the best way to using an SQL database for python objects? anything in twisted for handling that?
19:33 < Erwin> SQLObject looks fun
19:33 < Erwin> Dunno if it can handle multiple keys
19:34 < Erwin> But it's pretty powerful for giving an OO-like layer on top of SQL transparently

22:52 < blk-majik> can anyone give me some advice with a regular expression? I have a re.sub that is suposed to replace any time with <time>\1</time> (like a generic xml tagger). For example, 1:48 pm will be <time>1:48 pm</time>. Everything works fine, except for exmaple, when it sees something like 4 americans and tags <time>4 am</time>ericans. i cant think of how to avoid this without also tagging white space. any ideas?
22:52 < ivan> hmm i copied it just like the README file said to do
22:52 < ivan> into site-packages
22:52 < ivan> blk-majik: stop using a regular expression and split the string and use humane string methods to poke around with it
22:53 < ivan> is your irc client replacing am with americans?

23:09 < Yhg1s> operator.add is the same thing as +
23:09 < theuni> ic
23:10 < theuni> so it's one function frame less?
23:10 < Yhg1s> no,
23:10 < pyn> <princerps@ircnet> but you get rid of the lambda

23:11 < Yhg1s> you also don't need to worry about the method princepsd gave... and I would personally write it using a list comprehension anyway.
23:11 < theuni> ok. but actually calling a function or not does *do* work. so it's still something that needs to be done for each call ...
23:11 < Yhg1s> newlist = [x for x in y for y in oldlist]
23:12 < theuni> oh. hmm. never thought about that in list comprehension
23:12 < Yhg1s> princepsd's point is that Python functions (written in Python, like the result of lambda) are much slower than builtin functions (written in C)
23:12 < theuni> sure
23:13 < theuni> thanks for enlightening :)
23:13 < Yhg1s> but it's not important to worry about that until you really have to (and in that case, you probably don't want to use nested lists anyway. :)
23:13 < theuni> jupp

23:13 < pyn> <princerps@ircnet> thats why you want to avoid them in map if you can ;))

18:00 < ironfroggy> gee, thats tough to figure out. what could cause that?
18:01 < ironfroggy> hmmm maybe you are out of memory?
18:01 < mithro> so anyone know how to make do that for loop without the for loop?
18:01 < ironfroggy> whats wrong with the for loop
18:01 < Setzer> iron: Nope, infact I just upped the memory thinking that was the problem.  But it's not.
18:01 < ironfroggy> how much memory
18:01 < Setzer> I have 412M free
18:01 < Setzer> (512M total)
18:02 < Setzer> and zero swap being used.
18:02 < ironfroggy> im about to get a new 512 meg chip. up me to 640
18:02 < ironfroggy> zero swap....
18:02  * ironfroggy drools
18:02  * ironfroggy hates swap _so much_
18:02 < MoonFallen> you almost never have zero swap during real usage
18:02 < ironfroggy> i wish swap had never been invented. they should have just increased the RAM faster
18:02 < ironfroggy> MF: 640 megs will take even me a while to fill
18:02 < Yhg1s> hm, anyone here played with newstyle classes in C yet ?
18:03 < ironfroggy> Yhg1s: wha?
18:03 < Setzer> I almost never use swap on this system.
18:03 < MoonFallen> ironfroggy: irrelevant.  the memory management routines have to put stuff in swap _before_ memory fills up, or your computer would lock up
18:03 < Yhg1s> ironfroggy: if you don't understand the question, the answer is 'no' :)
18:03 < MoonFallen> it's usually based on how recently a page was used
18:03 < ironfroggy> Setzer: thats my goal. swap slows everything down. especially when all you have is IDE drives
18:03 < ironfroggy> Yhg1s: what are they
18:03 < Yhg1s> ironfroggy: nothing to concern yourself with.
18:03 < Yhg1s> and swap actually speeds up your machine
18:04 < ironfroggy> MoonFallen: it would take me a long time to get it to that point even.
18:04 < Yhg1s> unused memory gets sent to swap, and the remaining memory is used for buffers. Makes a heck of a difference.
18:04 < ironfroggy> NOO i dont want to use ANY swap
18:04 < Yhg1s> wrong.
18:04 < ironfroggy> i know what im talking about
18:04 < Yhg1s> trust me, your kernel knows better.
18:04 < ironfroggy> ive done it before and its sweet
18:04 < Setzer> so anyways.  I have lots of memory. limits are all set above 20M for various things, but I'm still getting this memory error with cPickle.dumps()
18:04 < ironfroggy> my kernel is windows. it doesnt know better.
18:05 < ironfroggy> im tired of unused memory getting sent to swap
18:05 < ironfroggy> i hate that so much
18:05 < Yhg1s> oh, windows, heh.
18:06 < ironfroggy> im tired of every time im talking in IRC for more than 5 minutes it takes me another 5 minutes to get the Mozilla window to open up again
18:06 < jonez> perhaps I'm missing something, but how does unused memory get sent to swap?
18:06 -!- jemfinch [~jfincher@ts30-9.homenet.ohio-state.edu] has joined #python
18:06 < exarkun> jonez: that is a very platform specific question
18:06 < ironfroggy> jonez: the page is written to the swap file and freed in memory
18:06 < MoonFallen> jonez: the memory scheduler does that based on somewhat-arbitrary and mystical criteria
18:06 < exarkun> jonez: the only generally applicable answer tends to be "kernel magic"
18:06 < MoonFallen> it's not a bug, it's just inefficient
18:07 < faassen> heuristics. :)
18:07 < jonez> but if it's unused, why send it to swap? the page isn't 'dirty', thus a write to swap is unnecessary.
18:07 < jonez> but I'll hush up now :)
18:07 < ironfroggy> on one of my old machines when i upgraded to an amazing 20 megs, i turned swap off completely.

19:14 < Royal> ok how? .... i have classes there what need to read the variables repetedly
19:14 < exarkun> Onikage: good point, nevermind.
19:15 < MoonFallen> and then run mktap.. maybe it is giving up before it starts to look for the plugins file
19:15 < ironfroggy> oooo i see the problem...
19:15 < Royal> and the variables will change...
19:15 < exarkun> Royal: pass the variable to __init__, save it

19:25 < Royal> :D
19:25 < ironfroggy> MF: ouch

19:25 < MoonFallen> there might be a bug or two in it
19:25 < ironfroggy> it appears so
19:26 < Onikage> so there is no way to use umask to change the chmod of existing files? whether it be owned by a user or owned by nobody?
19:26 < ironfroggy> yay i got the tap
19:27 < ironfroggy> ok it works now

19:29 < ironfroggy> yeah it looks like it

19:30 < ironfroggy> later
19:30 < Onikage> which brings me to the problem of having a chmod 0777 always... where anyone can alter the values as they wish :/
19:31 < exarkun> Onikage: What problem are you trying to solve?
19:32 < Onikage> i want my python-cgi script to read and write from files , but have them secure 0755 when they are not being read or written to
19:33 < Pryon> and you can't use chmod?
19:33 < jamessan> why not have the owner of the files be that of whatever python-cgi stuff is run as and then chmod them 0700?
19:33 < Onikage> problem is... i cannot use os.chmod() from the webserver because I either own the file (if I create it initially) or nobody owns it (if i make the python script create it)... is there any way around it?
19:34 < jamessan> if the python scripts creates it, it should be able to chmod it
19:34 < Onikage> Pryon - no because only the owner can chmod and the webserver isnt the owned of the file that is being read/written to
19:35 < Onikage> well... the only ways to assign owners in python - i thought - is that it is automatically assigned... if the python script creates the file, nobody owns it
19:35 < Onikage> and if i create it, and just call it from the python script, i own it
19:36 < jamessan> the user nobody owns it, right? if python-cgi runs as user nobody, then it can modify the files it creates.
19:36 < Onikage> how do you set the python-cgi to run as user nobody?
19:37 < Onikage> because i have tried making the file in python (owner = nobody) and tried changing permission thereafter in python script.. and it didnt change the chmod
19:37 < jamessan> if it creates a file, and that file is owned by nobody (as in the user) then that means that python-cgi is running as nobody

19:44 < Onikage> because at 0755 i cannot write to it from the webserver
19:45 < Onikage> remember im using python-cgi
19:45 < exarkun> Onikage: chown the file to the webserver user.
19:45 < jamessan> why not? if it is created by the webserver, then the 7 of 0755 is what matters. that should give it free reign over the file
19:45 < sethl> got em: http://pyopenssl.sourceforge.net/
19:46 < Onikage> but that is the thing... if it is creater serverside in python.. the user is nobody

19:46 < Onikage> user = owner

19:47 < Onikage> ive checked permissions after it is created and it says owner = nobody
19:48 < Onikage> not permission.. i mean ownership
19:48 < jamessan> then it will be owned by the user that the webserver is running as. that implies that the webserver is running as nobody

13:08 < Erwin> when you print a single value,with print, it uses str which rounds

00:37 < radix> hal22: Which operations
00:37 < radix> hal22: And what kind of data
00:37 < hal22> List operations == adding a known number of elements (say 100)
00:37 < hal22> and getting it back again
00:37 < hal22> er, unsigned chars :)
00:37 < chrchr> hal22: If you want to reasonably fast list operations, you want Java. That just isn't our bag.
00:37 < hal22> Hmm....
00:37 < radix> hal22: appending?
00:38 < radix> Don't listen to chrchr
00:38 < chrchr> hal22: Oh, 100? That'll take ... less than a flicker of the eye. I wouldn't worry about it one way or another.
00:38 < hal22> Not a whole lot of appending- a lot of accessing tho
00:38 < hal22> well
00:38 < hal22> 100 at a time
00:38 < slinkp> chrchr: bah
00:38 < drewp> chrchr: because of java's special self-definition of "fast"? :)

09:52 < exarkun> jemfinch: I guess since I never formally prove any of my programs correct, I'm not so interested in reasoning about their behavior.  Where static typing provides you with some kind of safety net, it doesn't protect you from the vast majority of classes of errors.  For a wider safety net, you need correct specifications and extensive unit tests.
09:53 < exarkun> jemfinch: I might go further and suggest that static typing doesn't even really help you reason about the behavior of a program, it just creeps into the place where proper documentation should be.
09:53 < exarkun> Instead of telling the people using an API what they should be passing in, you're telling the compiler.
09:55 < Aether> norway, norway, where is norway...
09:55 < SamB> exarkun: it also helps optimizations
09:56 < Aether> hmm, pyn is in #Zope

09:57 < exarkun> And #europython

15:03 < shapr> Yhg1s: is your system small?
15:04 < Yhg1s> shapr: how do you define 'small' ?
15:04 < Yhg1s> eugene: for instance, on my system, 'ulimit -a' shows me:

15:04 < Yhg1s> shapr: no, 'even, on my system'

15:05 < shapr> ah, I see.. ok

15:40 < ^self> the db is sorta shared -- one process opens it rw and writes to it.  the other process opens it ro every so often, reads a few values, and closes it

15:41 < Erwin> what do you mean, an additional module?
15:41 < ^self> why so, kuru?
15:41 < Erwin> bsddb is part of python
15:41 < kuru> ^self, cause bsddb, although a part of python, requires that you have libdb1
15:41 < ^self> oh...so it is.  hmm.  learn something new every day.
15:41 < ^self> i have libdb1, it's a freebsd box.
15:42 < ^self> freebsd has db1 in libc
15:42 < kuru> ^self, in many cases, people don't have libdb1
15:42 < Erwin> $ ldd /usr/lib/python2.2/lib-dynload/bsddb.so
15:42 < kuru> ^self, if you don't have libdb1 bsddb won't install.
15:42 < Erwin>         libdb-4.1.so => /usr/lib/libdb-4.1.so (0x40010000)
15:42 < kuru> Erwin, well it's the same API, so I guess that works.
15:43 < kuru> I just released a program using bsddb and it's giving people hell.
15:43 < kuru> not everyone.. just some people.
15:43 < Erwin> anyway, if you want, use anydbm instead which will use whatever is available
15:43 < kuru> if it's just something for your own use, who cares.
15:43 < kuru> Erwin, yeah, but the db itself has to be created by something, no?
15:44 < Erwin> if it's the same machine that both processes are running on then you theorethically don't care about the db format

16:54 < zicc> please, how could i use the __init__ function from a superclass?

16:55 < plaisthos> is there some easy way to store a array of strings in a config file

17:52  * Riff wanders in
17:53 < Riff> can anyone give me a reason why python wouldn't call the garbage collector when a class finishes?
17:53 < werneck> Riff: what do you mean ??? when an instance don't have any more references ???
17:54 < Riff> werneck; I have a class with an __init__ and a __del__
17:54 < Riff> __init__ is getting called on construction
17:54 < Riff> but __del__ isn't getting called, even though I am not implicitly calling del(foo)
17:55 < Riff> s/not/now/
17:55 < werneck> Riff: right... but __del__ is only called when the instance don't have any more references pointing to it... calling del(reference) doesn't call __del__...
17:56 < werneck> del() just decreases the reference count for the object by 1... when it reaches zero, then the object may, or may not be garbage collected....
17:56 < Riff> werneck; fair enough
17:56 < Riff> however, when execution is finished, surely __del__ is called then
17:56 < philipss> bye

17:57 < werneck> Riff: when all the references to the instance are destroyed, then __del__ is called...
17:57 < Riff> werneck; I get that, but that implies that it at least has to be called before python finishes and returns to shell

18:19 < pyn> <id9848949@ircnet> DarkStorm: well, in "b = a" is b reference:)
18:19 < KCN> DarkStorm: another solution would be to pass a list that contains a variable
18:19 < pyn> <id9848949@ircnet> i have problem with curses module, it says: AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'initscr'. dunno why
18:19 < DarkStorm> Ah well if i have buffer = [ somelist ] and processBuffer( buffer ) wants to modify the buffer, is the original modified ?
18:20 -!- nerdboy [~sarnold@arnolds.dhs.org] has joined #python
18:20 < KCN> DarkStorm: if you use buffer +=, it is not, if you use buffer.append, it is

18:20 -!- tirloni [~gpt@pixies.tirloni.org] has joined #python
18:20 < werneck> DarkStorm: depends if the function processbuffer returns a new list or just modify the existing one, :)
18:21 < DarkStorm> It should modify the existing one
18:21 < werneck> DarkStorm: so, it modified... you may pass a copy of it to the function, like processBuffer(list[:])
18:21 < KCN> DarkStorm: del buffer[i:] modifies buffer and truncates
18:21 < DarkStorm> Hm, has buffer[ 0 : packetLen ] = [] the same effect ?
18:22 < DarkStorm> Thats not really truncating but sth. similar
18:22 < KCN> DarkStorm: you can easily test that out
18:23 < KCN> DarkStorm: just assign your object to another variable, do your modifications and then test if they are identical ("is")
18:25 < DarkStorm> Thanks a lot KCN, that worked for me. Thats quite confusing hehe.

20:21 < legodude> wxpython is very cool
20:21 < Riff> I haven't played with it personally, but I think it does what you're after
20:21 < legodude> I did some quick stuff with it
20:21 < legodude> very easy to get going
20:21 < teratorn> Tyrol: yes, it is very good
20:22 < teratorn> legodude: not really
20:22 < teratorn> wx has a high learning curve
20:22 < teratorn> well, higher than most, anyway
20:22 < legodude> teratorn: for simple hello world type stuff I found it very easy
20:22 < Tyrol> teratorn: which one's good...qt or wx?
20:22 < legodude> I've not done anything much extensive though
20:22 < teratorn> Tyrol: qt can't access native widgets, it does it's own rendering, for good reason.
20:23 < teratorn> legodude: well yeah, they would all be about the same for that kind of thing :)
20:23 < Tyrol> teratorn: what kind of reason?
20:23 < teratorn> there are lots and lots of inconsistencies in the way widgets work under wx
20:23 < teratorn> since it uses gtk on *nix and MFC on windows, and i'm not sure what on mac
20:23 < werneck> legodude: it segfaults
20:24 < Tyrol> teratorn: ok but what if I'm on Windows?
20:24 < teratorn> Tyrol: it uses an unreasonable amount of ram, has a slow startup time, and i've found it unstable at times (reports differ on that one)
20:24 < werneck> pygtk is better, and there's a very nice ide for it

00:10 < legodude> only dual 800
00:10 < legodude> but it's CompactPCI
00:10 < legodude> I like my computers strange
00:10 < ameoba> what you rocking now?
00:11 < legodude> this one is dual xeon
00:11 < legodude> 500s, soon to be 550s with 1mb cache apiece
00:11 < ameoba> xeon ___?
00:11 < ameoba> not really much of a bump...
00:11 < legodude> nah
00:12 < ameoba> at least going from a 100FSB to a 133FSB?
00:12 < legodude> dunno about that
00:12 < legodude> probably won't even replace this machine with it
00:12 < legodude> but the dual 800 can do real time compositing on dual SDI video streams with it's custom hardware
00:12 < legodude> and I got it for cheap

16:26 < Yhg1s> [bluszcz]: you don't need to understand.
16:27 < hendry> How do I grab all the vars in my class? e.g. ['__doc__', '__init__', '__module__', '__str__', 'cat', 'dog'] just 'cat', and 'dog' 
16:27 < hendry> vars is probably the wrong term, maybe someone can suggest a better one  ?
16:27 < Yhg1s> [bluszcz]: all you need to know is that when you call 'foo.py/func?arg1=something&arg2=something', mod_python imports 'foo.py' and calls the function 'func' with 'req' (the requestion object) and 'arg1' and 'arg2' as arguments.
16:27 < Yhg1s> hendry: dir()
16:28 < hendry> Yhg1s: dir() returns '__doc__', '__init__', stuff I don't want... 
16:28 < Yhg1s> hendry: oh, wiat, without __doc__ and such
16:28 < hendry> Yhg1s: yes
16:28 < Yhg1s> hendry: well, you can filter it, or you can look at object.__dict__
16:28 < Yhg1s> hendry: but neither might be what you want.
16:29 < Yhg1s> hendry: (filtering shows methods, not just data variables, and object.__dict__ doesn't show data variables that are inherited from parents.)

16:29 < Yhg1s> [bluszcz]: you know how regular function calls work, in Python, right ?
16:29 < Yhg1s> [bluszcz]: you can do "def func(arg1, arg2, arg): print arg1, arg2, arg3" and call 'func("firstarg", "secondarg", "thirdarg")', right ?
16:30 < hendry> Yhg1s: ok, so no shortcuts there. Nevrmnind...
16:30 < Yhg1s> hendry: well, depending on what you want, object.__dict__ may be what you want. It contains all instance data.
16:30 < Yhg1s> hendry: do you want to show instance data, or methods too ?

16:32 < Yhg1s> [bluszcz]: sure you can
16:32 < Yhg1s> [bluszcz]: it just doesn't do what you want.
16:33 < Yhg1s> [bluszcz]: If I recall correctly, in mod_python functions, you need to _return_ what you want the browser to see.
16:33 < Yhg1s> [bluszcz]: other than that, it's a perfectly normal function.
16:34 < [bluszcz]> yes
16:36 < Yhg1s> so, what is the problem ?
16:37 < Yhg1s> what are you trying to do that isn't working ?

21:14 < Peaker> no yucky camel except for classes
21:14 < dash> Peaker: sicko
21:15 < Peaker> dash: How do you write?
21:15 < dash> underscores are for magic dispatch

21:17 < dash> snibril: well, there's different kinds, of course
21:17 < Peaker> dash: Wouldn't it be healthier to not rely on the __nonzero__ behaviour of the returned attributes and use "if m is not None:" ?
21:17 < dash> in PB, it's "remote_" or "perspective_" and so forth, depending on what you're doing
21:18 < dash> Peaker: no
21:18 < Peaker> dash: Why?
21:18 < dash> Peaker: why would it matter?
21:18 < Peaker> dash: What if they return some instance that has a __call__ method, and just happens to be in a state where __nonzero__ returns 0
21:18 < snibril> Peaker: a callable is never false

21:21 < Peaker> Can you think of a container that should be callable?

21:21 < dash> snibril: you can do it
21:22 < snibril> dash: ok, SANE callables ;)
21:22 < dash> Peaker: making instances callable is pretty marginal
21:22 < dash> snibril: i agree
21:22 < dash> snibril: but we passed the bounds of sanity at the beginning of the conversation
21:22 < snibril> a callable defining __nonzero__ should indicate "con't call me right now" by defining it ;)

16:51 < evol-> amaka: everything is a reference in python
16:51 < con-fuse> what is wrong in this line:
16:51 < con-fuse>       5 to = sys.argv[1]  # send sms to
16:52 < hendry> con-fuse: makes no sense? 
16:52 < amak> evol-: no i'm doing for i in list: i = i.rstrip('>') and it doesnt change the list contents
16:52 < hendry> con-fuse: should there by a 5 there?
16:52 < pyn> <fusbar@ircnet> amak: no.. it should not..
16:53 -!- k3 [~maio@ACMik.org] has quit [Client Quit]
16:53 < amak> but it does, and i tryed to pass a variable to a function and he doesnt change the variable of the previous scope
16:54 < amak> tryed = tried
16:54 < con-fuse> hendry: no, this is just the line number. Sorry.
16:54 < bsdhammer> amak: I had a similar problem with an app I wrote the other day
16:55 < amak> bsdhammer: yes
16:55 < pyn> deralte@ircnet has quit (freenet.de BelWue.DE)
16:55 < pyn> <fusbar@ircnet> you bind the name "i" to i.rstrip(">")
16:55 < pyn> <fusbar@ircnet> that will not change the value in the list
16:55 < pyn> <fusbar@ircnet> ofcourse not..
16:55 < pyn> <fusbar@ircnet> amak: try the following code for example:  "def foo(l): l.append(2)"
16:55 < bsdhammer> appending the variables to a new list, I'm sure i'm missing something though
16:55 < pyn> <fusbar@ircnet> l = []
16:55 < pyn> <fusbar@ircnet> foo(l)
16:55 < evol-> Anyone here played with SQLite?
16:56 < pyn> <fusbar@ircnet> bsdhammer: do you know what "a = 3" does?
16:56 < amak> bsdhammer:but what if the argument is a number? evrything is ruined

14:41 < pyn> <zed2k@ircnet> is there a way to do some PERL magic like "if (/bla(.*)fasel/) { print $1; }" in python?
14:43 < Erwin> Yes, there is a re module in Python that does regular expressions
14:44 < pyn> <zed2k@ircnet> pyn: yep i know that. my question references to the possibility to retrieve a part of the matched string and use it afterwards (\1)

14:46 < zed2k> cfork: so my question was already relayed here, that is, I don't need to ask again, do I?
14:48 < cfork> sorry, I don't know perl
14:48 < cfork> Haven't used it for many years
14:48 < zed2k> ah, I already found an answer.
14:48 < cfork> excellent :)
14:49 < zed2k> what I was looking for is a what re.match().group() provides

14:55 < zed2k> cfork: just found it ;)
14:56 < cfork> yes
14:56 < zed2k> cfork: so what do you use for text processing? self-written parsing routines?
14:58 < cfork> text processing? hmm. I don't do much of it at uni, when I do.. I use self-written parsing routines
14:58 < cfork> I also like to do it in haskell/scheme or whateer
14:58 < cfork> whatever hobby language I'm using at the time
14:59 < cfork> I think vertically, regular expressions are horizontal
14:59 < zed2k> I'm afraid I don't get that
15:00 < zed2k> what do you mean by that?
15:01 < cfork> um/..
15:01 < cfork> perl regular expressions have a lot of information packed into a small area
15:01 < cfork> I like it spread out, and neat :)

16:15 < Erwin> I like fog's psycopg
16:15 < MCArkan> does it support commit and rollback ?
16:15 < Erwin> yes
16:16 < MCArkan> because pygresql doesn't
16:17 < pyn> <Marksman@ircnet> Erwin: sure?
16:17 < fog> MCArkan: uh? i am sure pygresql does support rollbacks.
16:17 < pyn> <Marksman@ircnet> my sources in my book dont have any mainloops
16:17 < MCArkan> fog: I may not using them wisely then
16:18 < MCArkan> doh
16:18 < MCArkan> my mistake
16:18 < fog> MCArkan: use psycopg :)
16:18 < MCArkan> fog: I was using them to insert a data with a serial as index
16:18 < Erwin> marksman: *shrug* get a python/tk tutorial off the web. e.g. http://gnosis.cx/publish/programming/charming_python_9.txt
16:18 < MCArkan> rollback doesn't insert the data, but the counter is increased
16:19  * fog thinks psycopg's very good, but he's a _little_ biased.
16:19 < pyn> <Marksman@ircnet> hm, perhaps i havent the best book bought
16:19 < MCArkan> fog: :)
16:19 < fog> MCArkan: that's right. counters are transaction-independent. you can't rollback a serial once you've incremented it.
16:20 < fog> MCArkan: it is a postgresql feature, not a bug :)
16:20 < MCArkan> well, my use is to sent this unique id back to the client
16:20 < MCArkan> but
16:21 < MCArkan> my trouble comes when there are 2 creation at the same time
16:25 < Erwin> the last-oid feature is per-transaction however

17:27 < xentrac> or Line = Line.replace("{m}", "")
17:27 < pyn> <Marksman@ircnet> yes "from string import *"
17:27 < xentrac> but the one you had isn't a syntax error
17:27 < xentrac> I don't recommend "from anything import *"
17:28 < xentrac> I'm perfectly OK with "from string import replace"
17:28 < pyn> <Marksman@ircnet> but i need several string functions..
17:29 < xentrac> well, you can import them all explicitly: from string import replace, foo, bar, baz
17:29 < xentrac> or you can call them as methods on the string objects if you're using a recent Python version
17:29 < Erwin> use the string object methods instead
17:29 < xentrac> or you can just name them explicitly: string.replace, string.foo, string.bar

17:30 < xentrac> I know it's an uphill battle to suggest that people type more
17:30 < thomasvs> what's the "new" way to define an exception in a module ? I need to subclass the ExceptionClass or something ?
17:30 < xentrac> but I suggest it because it makes your programs a lot more comprehensible.  If you import * from a module, I need to look in that module whenever I see a name I don't recognize in your code
17:31 < StevenK> class MyVeryOwnException(Exception):
17:31 < xentrac> if you import * from several modules, I need to look in all of them
17:31 < xentrac> and possibly pay attention to what order you imported in
17:31 < xentrac> ick!
17:31 < Rafterman> and if you import * from 2 places which have the same function, you can get very confused
17:31 < xentrac> do your readers a favor and don't import *
17:31  * Rafterman just learnt that the hard way

17:34 < xentrac> you might want to override __init__, but you don't have to
17:34  * StevenK looks for one of his exception
17:34 < StevenK> s
17:35 < StevenK> class UnpackException(Exception):
17:35 < StevenK>    def __init__(self, arg = None):
17:35 < StevenK>        self.arg = arg
17:35 < StevenK>    def __str__(self):

17:35 < StevenK> That's the entire thing.
17:35 < xentrac> StevenK: that __init__/__str__ pair doesn't really do anything useful; the base class versions do almost exactly the same thing

18:09 < davidfraser> pyn: sys.path is a normal list - sys.path.append('extra/path')

17:15 < pyn> <Sleepy-9@efnet> hello
17:18 < pyn> <Sleepy-9@efnet> question: is there a builtin way of converting "4" to (string) "0004"? I have done it using "0" * (len(str(number)) -len(str(number)) ) + str(number)
17:19 < VladDrak> "%0d" % some_int
17:19 < Erwin> is your "4" a string or number?
17:19 < VladDrak> erm
17:19 < VladDrak> "%04d" % some_int
17:19 < jonez> Erwin: string
17:20 < jonez> convert it first
17:20 < VladDrak> int(some_int) :)
17:20 < Erwin> I guess it's a number since you applied str to it. So you can do '%04d' % number as VladDrak suggested.
17:20 < pyn> <Sleepy-9@efnet> 4 is a number, but ultimately becomes a string. This is to numerically pad filenames.
17:20 < pyn> <Sleepy-9@efnet> AH... %04d!
17:21 < deltab> or str(n).zfill(4)
17:21 < pyn> <Sleepy-9@efnet> Programming Python is a great learning book...I need a good REFERENCE book.
17:21 < pyn> <Sleepy-9@efnet> I was making stuff up like %000d  :-)

17:24 < pyn> <Nemes@efnet> I got it last month and get good use out of it.
17:27 < pyn> <Sleepy-9@efnet> If you don't know C++ or Java, but want a book that teaches OO design and problem solving... is there such a book?
17:27 < pyn> <Sleepy-9@efnet> I make classes now, but I don't think out the design well.
17:29 < Erwin> There's the big Meyer Eiffel book.
17:30 < Erwin> Maybe the "Design Patterns" book would be better.
17:30 < pyn> <Sleepy-9@efnet> Hmm.
17:31 < pyn> <Sleepy-9@efnet> OK, I'll check out DP at the bookstore.
17:32 < pyn> <Sleepy-9@efnet> I do Perl, Python, and shell... and don't want to learn anything else now, so a book that teaches the concepts in a language-neutral or Python-specific manner is key
17:32 < Erwin> DP uses Java/C++ code for examples, UML diagrams for illustration.
17:33 < Erwin> But the pattern concepts are used in every OO language.
17:34 < deltab> some of the patterns don't apply so well to python
17:34 < Erwin> The author of the "Thinking in C++|Java" books started writing a "Thinking in Python" book at some point. Maybe that's also worth reading.
17:34 < Erwin> Well, they apply to Python but are just one-liners in Python :)
17:34 < pyn> <Sleepy-9@efnet> OK, I'll check it out anyways.
17:35 < pyn> <Sleepy-9@efnet> Cool... it's an ONLINE book. Sweet.

17:44 < queuetue> I remember now why I don't design websites for a living. Most programming is about learning to harness the beast and control it.  Web design is all about balancing the compromises you have to make because of the broken specifications and implementations.  Instead of a satisfying feeling, you always feel dirty and cheated...  Ugh.
17:44 < pyn> <Sleepy-9@efnet> Just curious... If I create a class containing variables and DON'T do "self.name = name"... can the var still be accessed outside the class code? How would I specify it (in other words, is "self.name = name" just aliasing so I can access the class avriable without some convoluted matter)?
17:44 < deltab> no, it's not aliasing
17:45 < deltab> it's setting an attribute of the instance
17:45 < deltab> instead of an attribute of the class
17:45 < queuetue> Sleepy:  How does a class "contain variables"?  You defined them under the class header?  Or you just used them in a method?  If you use them in a method, then they are gone when the method loses scope.

18:44 < deltab> that's something to put in a library
18:44 < deltab> if you just need a fixed size, use zip(it, it) :-)
18:45 < corecode> this *[]* thing i mean
18:45 < deltab> several parts to that:
18:46 < deltab> iter(iterable) makes an iterator over an iterable object I've imaginatively called 'iterable'
18:46 < corecode> yes, i understand that
18:46 < deltab> it could be a list, string, file, etc.
18:46 < corecode> anything iterable
18:46 < deltab> the [ ] around that make a one-item list
18:46 < corecode> yes
18:47 < deltab> * number multiplies that to the required length
18:47 < corecode> okay
18:47 < corecode> and the * makes it a standard argument list
18:47  * deltab nods 
18:47 < deltab> so you do understand it
18:47 < corecode> woo. this language rocks
18:48 < corecode> it could also have been a *[]*<number> construct

19:01 < kosh> what is the advantage of using iter over just iterating over the list?
19:01 < Erwin> you can't just iterate over the list in this case
19:02 < Erwin> otherwise with an iterator you can get one item at a time using .next() without having to keep track of your current position
19:03 < Erwin> of course, iter also has a two-argument version where you can turn e.g. a file into an iterator reading a block or character at a time

20:24 < bradb> i still have to figure out how to edit them productively in emacs though
20:25 < evol> Hmms
20:26 < evol> am I missing something or is the difference between using compiled and non-compiled templates pretty big
20:26 < evol> i find myself having to rewrite stuff to switch between the two
20:26 < bradb> there's no difference
20:26 < evol> ?
20:26 < bradb> well, except one you have to compile, and the other is just a string
20:27 < bradb> but in terms of template semantics, there's no difference
20:27 < evol> i was thinking about when calling thenm
20:28 < evol> for compiled there's something like 'from framework import framework; template = framework()", but for non-compiled it's "template = Template(file=path);"
20:29 < bradb> hmmmmm
20:29 < evol> why isn't there an identical way? :P
20:29 < bradb> i think when they're compiled, you probably just import the compiled module directly

20:33 < bradb> but still, that's pretty small
20:33 <@dash> evol: so, use twisted

20:33 <@dash> moshez: everything does. :)
20:33 < bradb> and that's just using a rough estimate: find . -name "*.py" -print | xargs wc -l
20:34 < evol> I'd use XSLT here, but I'm so fed up with it
20:34 < bradb> evol: don't use the Page class then

20:34 < bradb> evol: don't blame Webware for your not wanting to learn it though.
20:34 < _moshez> webware is evil because of other reasons
20:34 <@dash> xslt is a sorta-nice idea, executed horribly =/

20:35 <@dash> evol: Why?
20:35 <@dash> evol: Out of disk space?
20:35 < evol> bradb: I've written my own Page substitute class, but after that I didn't quite see what webware was going to do for me
20:35 < bradb> i'm even using Thread()s in my servlets without a problem
20:35 < _moshez> bradb: no you're not.
20:35 < evol> dash: no, complexity = rish

20:36 < _moshez> bradb: no, you're not.
20:36 < bradb> dash: well, the same could be said of most software
20:36 < evol> dash: Let's say I'm developing a project, stuff I don't understand is a risk, and stuff I don't need adds to that risk, it's the core of unix-dom, small, understandable components working together
20:36 < bradb> okay, this is silly
20:36 <@dash> evol: Why?
20:36 < bradb> i'm not going to waste time ranting abstracts
20:37 < _moshez> bradb: I saw the web shootout paper, written by a webware developer. the webware example had a race condition.

20:42 < pyn> <princeps@ircnet> yes, the thread-support in python is not the best

20:43 < _moshez> princeps: or any language where it's not completely structured around the concept
20:43 <@dash> yeah, langugages that support threads properly do not share the entire heap between all threads

01:12 <@dash> jozeph: the point is, perl is bad for you, and you'd be better off learning something else

12:58 < Yhg1s> yes.
12:58 < Yhg1s> lots of people.
12:58 < pyn> <Flux___@ircnet> chill
12:58 < Aether> I'm dead actually.
12:58 < Yhg1s> 'chill' ?
12:58 < pyn> <duplexer@efnet> Where's pyn?
12:58 < Yhg1s> what do you mean, 'where's pyn' ?
12:58 < pyn> <Flux___@ircnet> sorry, it's a habit, that word

12:59 < pyn> <duplexer@efnet> So, pyn is on freenode.
13:00 < Yhg1s> or did you have a specific Java type in mind ? you can use java classes from Jython.
13:00 < Yhg1s> duplexer: no, pyn is on all networks.
13:00 < Yhg1s> pyn: networks
13:00 < pyn> Connected to: oftc -> ('irc.oftc.net', 6667), efnet -> ('efnet.vuurwerk.nl', 6667), gimp -> ('irc.gimp.net', 6667), fn -> ('irc.freenode.net', 6667), ircnet -> ('irc.stealth.net', 6667)
13:00 < pyn> <Yosomono@efnet> duplexer: you are very confused
13:00 < pyn> <Flux___@ircnet> i don't have a specific type in mind... i want a list of lists
13:00 < pyn> <Flux___@ircnet> [[1,2,3][4,5,6][7,8,9]]
13:00 < pyn> <Flux___@ircnet> erhhh
13:00 < Yhg1s> Flux___: then use a list of lists :) [['foo', 'bar', 'baz'], ['spam', 'ham', 'eggs'], ['larry', 'darryl', 'darryl']]
13:00 < pandzilla> hm, Twisted sure looks interesting
13:01 < pyn> <Flux___@ircnet> if it's possible, i'd like them to be doubles
13:01 < Yhg1s> 'doubles' ?
13:01 < pyn> <Yosomono@efnet> heh
13:01 < pyn> <duplexer@efnet> So it links all the python channels :)
13:01 < pandzilla> I still feel like doing this C-style / manually (and possibly shoot my foot, hr hr hr)
13:01 < Yhg1s> do you mean tuples ?
13:01 < pyn> <Yosomono@efnet> duplexer: Yes. For now.
13:01 < pyn> <duplexer@efnet> Ah
13:01 < Yhg1s> [('foo', 'bar'), ('spam', 'ham')] ?
13:01 < pyn> <Flux___@ircnet> in java they're called dubles
13:01 < pyn> <Flux___@ircnet> doubles
13:01 < pyn> * duplexer@efnet does a happy, booty shaking dance
13:01 < Yhg1s> I don't know Java, sorry.

13:01 < pyn> <Flux___@ircnet> hmm
13:02 < pyn> <Flux___@ircnet> it's just 1.23456
13:02 < pyn> <Flux___@ircnet> that's a double
13:02 < pyn> <Yosomono@efnet> haha
13:02 < Yhg1s> Flux___: oh, a floating point number.
13:02 < pyn> <duplexer@efnet> Don't be alarmed Yosomono.
13:02 < pyn> <Flux___@ircnet> sort of
13:02 < pyn> <duplexer@efnet> It's a safe dance.

13:04  * duplexer walks away whistling
13:05 < pyn> <Flux___@ircnet> sorry Yhg1s
13:05 < pyn> <Flux___@ircnet> i was afk for a sec
13:05 < pyn> <Flux___@ircnet> yep, you're richt
13:05 < pyn> <Flux___@ircnet> right
13:05 < pyn> <Flux___@ircnet> in normal python, it's possible to install and import a numarray module
13:06 < pyn> <Flux___@ircnet> i can't figure out how this is possible in jython
13:06 < pyn> <Flux___@ircnet> any suggestions?
13:06 < Yhg1s> Flux___: the package is called Numeric, or NumPy. Why do you need it ?
13:06 < Yhg1s> I'm not sure if there is a Java version.
13:06 < pyn> <Flux___@ircnet> for the 2-dimensional arrays
13:06 < pyn> <Flux___@ircnet> that's what i found for it
13:06 < pyn> <Flux___@ircnet> but if you've got a better solution: spit it out! :)
13:07 < Yhg1s> yeah, but *why* do you need it ? Why are regular lists-in-lists not good enough ?
13:07 < Yhg1s> they are not truely two-dimensional, and they might lack some operations you want to perform, but you can work around it. It all depends on your exact needs.
13:07 < pyn> <Flux___@ircnet> i want to multiply the array with other arrays
13:08 < pyn> <Flux___@ircnet> is that possible?
13:08 < Yhg1s> sure, but by doing it manually :)
13:08 < pyn> <Flux___@ircnet> hmm
13:08 < Yhg1s> only takes a few lines of code though. But it does sound like you want Numeric, aye.
13:08 < pyn> Mode change on ircnet by princepsd: +oo ('e', 'princeps')

13:09 < Aether> Very confusing.
13:09 < pyn> <Flux___@ircnet> so lay down!
13:10 < pyn> <Flux___@ircnet> Yhg1s> any suggestions?

13:11 < pandzilla> hm... some people are really narcoleptic... like effugas (Dan Kaminsky) - he'd be awake for about 3 hours a day if he didn't constantly take ephedrine
13:11 < pyn> <Flux___@ircnet> i seem to have silenced the channel :)
13:11 < Yhg1s> Flux___: Nope, like I said, I don't use or know Java very well. You want Numerical Python (aka NumPy, Numeric) but I don't know if it's available for Jython.

18:09 < Jii_> you need to do the 'import string' in the phraseMatch module
18:09 < Zalamander> so...when I import a module, it cannot see the global namespace as it imports?
18:09 < Zalamander> Jii_ yes, I figured that out, but I don't understand why
18:09 < pyn> <e@ircnet> you have to import string in your module too.
18:09 < sfiggins> The module has it's own namespace.
18:09 < pyn> <e@ircnet> there is no global global namespace, just module-global
18:10 < Zalamander> imported module functions can *never* see the global namespace?
18:10 < Zalamander> ah ok
18:10 < pyn> <e@ircnet> there is no global namespace
18:10 < Jii_> zalamander, by the way, what are you using string-module for? just curious
18:10 < Zalamander> e gotcha
18:10 < sfiggins> Why did you not want to import in your modules?
18:10 < Zalamander> Jii_ string.punctuation, string.ascii, etc.
18:10 < pyn> <e@ircnet> the namespace at the prompt is just the namespace of the module __main__
18:11 < Zalamander> sfiggins I didn't *not* want to, I just didn't realize I had to until I got the error. Then I wanted to undertand WHY I had to.
18:11 < Jii_> zalamder, okay :)
18:11 < Zalamander> e is that different
18:11 < sfiggins> So it will exist in your module's namespace.

18:12 < flippo> The python import avoids bugs in ordering, as C includes are prone to have
18:13 < sfiggins> Yeah, Zal, you shouldn't run into problems if multiple modules import the same packages.
18:13 < Zalamander> flippo what kind of problems will ordering cause? Is python's behavior designed to avoid overwriting the namespace with similar module names?
18:13 < pyn> lamer343@efnet has parted
18:13 < pyn> <e@ircnet> well, python gets you problems with ordering too if you do cyclic imports.
18:13 < Zalamander> sfiggins an no real resource hit for multiple imports, right?
18:14 < sfiggins> Just the memory it takes to populate the namespace.
18:14 < flippo> Zalamander: you don't really want to force users of your modules to import them in a certain order
18:14 < pyn> <e@ircnet> "import foo" is just a dictionary lookup after the first time

13:11 < hendry> If I want random lines out a *huge* file, I should use linecache right?

13:15 < gt3> where
13:15 < skimpIzu> http://www.pythonware.com/daily/
13:16 < hendry> skimpIzu: text?
13:16 < gt3> cool
13:16 < skimpIzu> hendry: line cache says its for modules, so if its plain text, then its innappropriate
13:16 < hendry> skimpIzu: So what should I use instead? I don't want a huge list like readlines really
13:17 < skimpIzu> why
13:17 < skimpIzu> how big is file
13:17 < cybereal> linecache is for any text file
13:17 < cybereal> not just modules
13:17 < cybereal> it just happens that traceback uses it
13:17 < skimpIzu> DESCRIPTION
13:17 < skimpIzu>     This is intended to read lines from modules imported -- hence if a filename
13:17 < skimpIzu>     is not found, it will look down the module search path for a file by
13:17 < skimpIzu>     that name.
13:17 < skimpIzu> pydoc linecache
13:17 < sjj> hendry: are the lines likely to be long or short?
13:18 < cybereal> doesn't matter what it was intended for, when it works for other purposes just fine
13:18 < skimpIzu> cybereal: it does matter
13:18 < hendry> sjj: short
13:19  * red_one is away: tv
13:19 < sjj> hendry: then it would probably be ok to seek ahead a random number of bytes and read until the next newline, then read a line and repeat the process.
13:19 < cybereal> skimpIzu: come up with a reason why linecache shouldn't be used on any random text file you please.
13:20 < hendry> sjj: seems like hard work :)
13:20 < cybereal> hendry: how large of a file are we talking here?
13:20 < gt3> a peta file
13:20 < sjj> hendry: nah, it's easy ;)
13:20 < gt3> get it
13:22 < hendry> cybereal: 78M
13:22 < cybereal> hendry: and you intend to parse the whole thing in one shot?
13:22 < hendry> cybereal: I don't know. Just want to careful with memory.
13:22 < hendry> they are typically much smaller than 78M btw
13:23 < skimpIzu> hendry: why do you need a line in the middle of the file

13:40 < Airwulf> i want to meassure the time who a function needs
13:41 < cybereal> time.clock() is as precise as the host system can be
13:41 < cybereal> iirc
13:42 < cybereal> should read the man though, as it has some severe limitations and is not always the same, it's based use for delay calculation since the start time for it can be the system startup or process start, etc.

13:43 < cybereal> Airwulf: if the system can provide the time in increments more precise than seconds, then the float will indicate fractions thereof

16:37 < Cwiiis[away]> ah, I see
16:37 < Cwiiis[away]> clever :)
16:37 < burp> Erwin: Why is that better than just using an adapted cmp() function?  Is it because it can use built-in cmp?
16:38 < Erwin> yes, then you don't have to call a python function each time you compare 2 items, but use the builtin tuple comparison code, which is C

18:15 < Zalamander> does '_' by *itself* have a special significance in python? The example I'm reading that uses it appears to use it as nothing more than a conventional name for a variable that won't be used. Is there something more, i.e. var, _ = x.split(' ',1)
18:16 < Zalamander> (this example from a post by moshez, if you're around)
18:16 < ctgPi> On an interpreter, recalls the last result printed
18:17 < BradB> i thought that was in the tutorial
18:17 < ctgPi> interpreter = interactive shell
18:17 < Zalamander> it's not in any of the books I've read
18:17 < Zalamander> last result printed...but the example appears to FILL that variable, so in this case, I guess it's not being used like that
18:17 -!- sam22 [~root@dpvc-151-204-174-52.ny325.east.verizon.net] has quit ["leaving"]
18:17 < BradB> Zalamander: That's because it's of little use, except perhaps to use the interactive interpreter as a calculator.
18:18 < Zalamander> BradB ok, then I'll assume the use of it here is as it appears -- simply to signify a throw-away value
18:18 < Taaus> Zalamander: _ is just another variable... I've seen Pygame sources where it was used instead of 'self'... That was awful, I can tell you.
18:18 < BradB> It almost looks like some idea Guido got from Larry, and then thought "ooookay, that's enough trying to look like Perl, back to doing something sane"
18:18 < Zalamander> Taaus ouch
18:19 < BradB> actually, gettext uses it, now that I think about it (but I believe they define a _ method)
18:19 < BradB> Speaking on thinking about things, I need to do some work.

23:51 < mg> dash: ok, will do

23:57 < glyph> cybereal: not merely because it is better (it is actually in a state of flux, and it is being re-written and enhanced right now) but because it is being maintained by other people who are thinking hard about these issues

00:03 < radix> The thought of a Java VM for Twisted is terrifying
00:04 < cybereal> hm... but is it really necssary when most of the protocol won't require more than 'MOVE UP' or 'MOVE DOWN' and bandwidth is going to be pretty tight...

15:32 < stranger> lm0re: the opcodes (aka bytecode) are what run on the vm.
15:33 < stranger> but it's NOT a trivial project
15:33 < lm0re> stranger: i know, i just want to know the fundamental
15:34 < djdennie> lm0re: try this: http://compilers.iecc.com/crenshaw/
15:35 < djdennie> basically you need to write a program that interprets code...
15:36 < metoo> hei is it possible to sort a  dictionary ?
15:36 < vegai> metoo: no
15:36 < metoo> :(
15:36 < lm0re> what target code the bytecode translate into? machine-dependent code?  assemble code?
15:36 < metoo> why is so?
15:36 < vegai> you can sort the keys, though
15:36 < metoo> keys means its again the list
15:37 < pyn_> Jakis@ircnet has parted
15:37 < stranger> lm0re: it doesn't translate into anything (well in the basic case)
15:37 < djdennie> lm0re: well if your interpreter is portable, it should work on any platform.
15:38 < stranger> lm0re: bytecode runs on the vm like a shell script runs on bash
15:39 < stranger> metoo: a dict is unordered.... that's kinda the point :)
15:40 < metoo> oohhhhh
15:40 < lm0re> stranger: for shell command "echo", what does bash do underlying?
15:41 < stranger> lm0re: roughly speaking bash sees "echo args..." recognises the first string as a builtin command and calls an internal function e.g. do_echo(args)

19:12 < MFen> plaisthos: you don't "have to". it depends on what you want
19:12 < Glammie> Tenshi, you don't, really.
19:12 < Zalamander> Tenshihan|work I'm sorry, I don't know what a "query param" is
19:12 < Tenshihan|work> Hellfried: http://oz209-03.cast.uark.edu/website/nomap/
19:12 < Glammie> Zalamander, he means pass by reference so that you can alter the value.
19:12 < Zalamander> um
19:12 < Tenshihan|work> Zalamander: Http query params. http://someurl?&foo=bar
19:13 < Glammie> as in    increment(x): x=x+1
19:13 < philiKON> hmm, smtplib.SMTP.sendmail adds a rcpt TO: <the_to_address@todomain>. then my smtp server tells me, "relaying email for todomain is prohibited". is what smtplib does correct?

19:14 < Roey> hi
19:14 < Hellfried> Tenshihan|work: that doesn't tell you much, try looking at the source
19:14 < Roey> is there a decent binding for kde?

19:15 < Roey> I only see pyqt
19:15 < Roey> (in debian at least)
19:15 < Glammie> Tenshi, you could do:   apply(getPage,[],keyword_arguments)
19:15 < cow_2001> plaisthos, yes, you were right. it does add the " "
19:15 < Tenshihan|work> Glammie: sounds good
19:15 < Tenshihan|work> what is apply?
19:15 < cow_2001> i'll use the sys.os thingie
19:15 < Tenshihan|work> for that matter, what is a deferred?
19:15 < Glammie> Roey, hmm.. there's python-gtk but that'd be gnome, eh?
19:16 < Glammie> Tenshihan, a deferred is a pretty crucial concept to Twisted.. the docs should have a pretty detailed description.
19:16 < Glammie> Roey, but look for things named python-*
19:16 < Glammie> Tenshihan, basically it's a promise from the system to deliver a value later.
19:16 < Glammie> Tenshihan, so that some processing doesn't need to be done right away.
19:17 < Glammie> Tenshihan, apply is a builtin Python function to apply a function to some arguments.
19:17 < Tenshihan|work> how do I get a deferred to do it's duty?
19:17 < Glammie> for instance,  apply(foo,(1,2)) would have the same effect as  foo(1,2)
19:18 < Tenshihan|work> I can't find the documentation on deferred
19:18 < Roey> Glammie:  I did
19:18 < Glammie> Tenshihan, the twisted docs should tell this all in detail..  Look for a tutorial or introduction.
19:18 < philiKON> psy: the "yes" was for my smtp question?
19:18 < Hellfried> Glammie: he could as well foo(*(1,2))
19:18 < Glammie> Tenshihan, trying tu understand twisted just from the API docs will be very difficult without first reading the intro.
19:18 < Glammie> Hellfried, why the *?
19:19 < Hellfried> Glammie: to expand
19:19 < Hellfried> Glammie: like foo(**mydict)
19:19 < Glammie> oh..  so..   tupl=(1,2)  foo(*tupl) works?
19:19 < Hellfried> Glammie: yes
19:19 < Glammie> cool
19:19 < Roey> Hellfried: that works?  *(...) ?
19:20 < Roey> and **(...) ?

19:34 < pyn> <`e@ircnet> cow: that would cause the TypeError you mentioned, since os.write takes a integer (fd) as first argument and you are passing it a file object.

22:15 < exarkun> Tenshihan|work: Where?  On what?
22:15 < Zalamander> I'm looking for implementation suggestions: I have an indefinite number of lists, and I want to find those items common to all of them.
22:15 -!- LordVan [~lordvan@62.218.218.165] has joined #python
22:16 < Zalamander> Everything I've thought of so far feels awkward, probably due to my inexperience

22:17 < Tenshihan|work> exarkun: I was using urllib to do a POST to a page and it hung then gave an assertion error
22:17 < exarkun> Zalamander: iterate over the shortest list.  test each element for containment within all the other lists.
22:18 < exarkun> Tenshihan|work: urllib?  Eh?
22:18 < Tenshihan|work> ya
22:19 < Tenshihan|work> what I wrote hung in twisted, so I decided to step back and use urllib

22:20 < exarkun> Zalamander: If you can constraint your list contents to be hashable objects, a dictionary oculd improve the algorithm still further.
22:20 < Tartaros> heya
22:20 < exarkun> s/constraint/constrain/
22:20 < Tartaros> oh
22:21 < Tartaros> i would never say that some python irc would have so many people on :)
22:21 < Kengur> don't use anything that provides bugs out of the box
22:21 < MFivis> I really can't figure it out. Maybe i shouldn't touch it. On a simpler note, someone reccomended I simplify this www.outeraspects.com/dev/pythag.py
22:21 < Tenshihan|work> oh oh, I have a new game. it's called I hate the people who wrote ArcIms :D
22:21 < exarkun> Kengur: All non-trivial software has bugs.
22:22 < Tartaros> is there something like python web forums somewhere?
22:22 < exarkun> Tartaros: bioinformatics.org/events/2003/ 3am/slides/bizzaro_jw.pdf
22:22 < MFivis> python questions get answered at linuxforums.com
22:23 < Kengur> exarkun: yeh, but when it doesn't even start, the stable release!
22:24 < Zalamander> exarkun how would a dictionary help me in this case?
22:24 < Tartaros> linuxforums.com does not exist...
22:24 < Tartaros> and the bioinformatics page doesnt exist also
22:24 < Tartaros> but anyway thanx :)
22:25 < exarkun> Zalamander: Iterate over all of your lists, adding each element to the dictionary as a key with a value of 1 if it is not already present, or adding one to the value already stored if it is present
22:25 < exarkun> Zalamander: When you finish, the keys which are associated with a value equal to the number of lists you have are those which belonged to all the lists.
22:25 < Zalamander> hmm, that could be just the ticket
22:26 < Zalamander> thanks again, I'm off to play with these ideas
22:26 < Pahan> exarkun: Grrr, he'll end up using has_key instead of setdefault.
22:26 < Zalamander> Pahan don't bet on it
22:26 < exarkun> Pahan: You can't do "d.setdefault(k, 0) += 1"
22:26 < MFivis> what can I do to reduce this at www.outeraspects.com/dev/pythag.py
22:27 < Pahan> exarkun: d.etdefault(k,0)++!!!!11
22:27 < Pahan> :(
22:27 < exarkun> Pahan: Hehe
22:27 < exarkun> MFivis: Write a function
22:27 < Pahan> exarkun: He can do d[k] = d.setdefault(k,0) + 1
22:28 < Pahan> exarkun: I hope lvalue is not evaluated prematurely.
22:28 < exarkun> Of course not.
22:28 < MFivis> what would the function do
22:28 < Tartaros> is there some working module that can accept telnet calls?
22:28 < exarkun> MFivis: Look at your code.  You have three blocks that are identical save the values they operate on.

22:29 < MFivis> hmm okay, I will try and solve the problem
22:29 < Tenshihan|work> is urllib slow or is that just my stuff?
22:29 < exarkun> Tartaros: twisted
22:29 < Pahan> Tenshihan|work: Use Twisted!
22:29 < Tartaros> umm
22:29 < Tartaros> what? :)

22:30 < Kengur> who's in charge of twisted enlightenment today?
22:30 < Pahan> Tenshihan|work: ethereal, too.
22:30 < Pahan> Kengur: exarkun is. I am assisting.
22:30 < Tartaros> what is actually "Twisted"??
22:31 < ivan> it's a network framework
22:31 < Kengur> it's an asyncore network with network support
22:31 < Zalamander> min(ListofLists) <-- should return the shortest list, yes?
22:31 < Kengur> *asyncore framework
22:31 < Tenshihan|work> Pahan: got a link
22:31 < Tenshihan|work> ?
22:31 < ivan> Zalamander: interactive python
22:32 < Pahan> Tenshihan|work: www.ethereal.com
22:32 < Kengur> crap.. my head is messed up!
22:32 < Pahan> Tenshihan|work: Wait, no, "apt-get install ethereal"
22:32 < Zalamander> ivan interactive python only tells me that my example works that way. Not that it works that way because my assumption is correct
22:32 < Tenshihan|work> Pahan: you wish I was using debian
22:32 < Tenshihan|work> :((
22:32 < Tartaros> and do they release .py or .pyo?
22:32 < Tartaros> .pic
22:32 < Tartaros> i mean
22:32 < Tartaros> pyc
22:32 < Tartaros> lol
22:33 < Tartaros> you know what  i want to know :)
22:33 < Kengur> Zalamander: no lists are sorted according to the first value by default
22:33 < ivan> lol police, engage weapons
22:33 < itamar> >>> min([1], [0, 2])
22:33 < itamar> [0, 2]
22:33 < Zalamander> ah
22:33 < exarkun> Kengur: No, they are sorted according to all values by default

22:34 < exarkun> Tartaros: Why does it matter?
22:34 < Kengur> exarkun: well if the first are equal then next go into play
22:35 < Tartaros> because i like to know how things work
22:35 < Tartaros> and because ive today seen the python for the first time, itd be good for learning :)

22:47 < exarkun> MFivis: Heh.
22:47 < Tenshihan|work> so this is strange
22:47 < Tenshihan|work> a request with a web browser take 2 seconds, with python and urllib it sits forever
22:48 < exarkun> strace
22:48 < exarkun> Maybe a DNS issue.
22:48 < Tenshihan|work> how do I strace?

22:55 < exarkun> MFivis: Two things
22:55 < exarkun> MFivis: linear is bad
22:56 < exarkun> MFivis: linear is the antithesis of programming
22:56 < exarkun> MFivis: loops are critical to do anything non-trivial

23:02 < Tenshihan|work> drewp: the opposite of urllib.urlencode...

23:06 < MFivis> Is there a way to enter the degree sign in Linux
23:06 < MFivis> I know how to do it in windows
23:06 < Aether> parsing HTML sucks
23:07 < drewp> MFivis: i'd guess it works the same as other characters. you can type it into a string, use a \x00 form, prepare it with chr(0), etc

23:13 < Tartaros> how to access a file path to a modul I`m in?
23:13 < MFivis> hey how do oyu enter in fractions to python
23:13 < exarkun> drewp: There is actually a B.__init__.  It calls super(B, self).__init__()

23:15 < exarkun> I don't like this solution, but I don't see another one.
23:15 < exarkun> MFivis: "0.33333333333333333333"
23:15 < MFivis> the wholepart module though, is it a module?
23:16 < exarkun> no
23:16 < MFivis> oh okay

23:16 < exarkun> <wholepart>.<fractionalpart>
23:16 < exarkun> drewp: B's init explicitly cooperates, though.

23:20 < exarkun> Pahan: Well, -yes-.  But only because now I expect it to work how it does.  Not because it behaves how I want it to.

23:30 < cybereal> MFivis: goto doesn't exist in OOP, or, if for whatever reason it did, it shouldn't
23:30 < MFivis> refer to a variable value or something
23:30 < cybereal> MFivis: put it in a define
23:31 < cybereal> er def
23:31 < cybereal> then just call the def
23:31 < MFivis> what would that look like
23:31 < drewp> MFivis: i recommend a function called "c_to_f" which accepts a celsius number and returns the F one

23:31 < MFivis> def c_to_f:
23:31 < MFivis> and then whats after that
23:31 < drewp> MFivis: then the user interface part (the printing and input stuff) can call c_to_f to get the conversion done

01:43 < pyn> <prell@efnet> Hello, all.  I'm interested in writing a Python extension, and I'm wondering, am I limited to C, or can I use C++?  I'd consider Jython, but I don't want to require too much of the user.
01:43 < kiko> dash: any clue?
01:44 < Glammie> prell, yeah.. you can use C++
01:44 < exarkun> kiko: What do you return from __cmp__?
01:44 < dash> prell: well, the question is, why would you _want_ to use C++?
01:44 < dash> prell: what sort of extension are you writing?
01:44 < kiko> exarkun: it's a complicated cmp, because this instance needs to be used in a BTree (it's for IndexedCatalog)
01:44 < Erwin> prell: It's easy to extend python with C++ using e.g. boost::python
01:44 < pyn> <prell@efnet> dash: I'm afraid that after so long writing Python and Java code, I can't bring myself to write some lower level functions ;-)
01:44 < kiko> exarkun: I return -1, 0 or +1, or the result of PyObject_Compare

01:45 < pyn> <prell@efnet> Erwin: yea I saw that!!  I was wondering what it was but alas, I haven't looked much
01:45 < pyn> <prell@efnet> dash: yEnc
01:45 < Erwin> prell: However, there is some memory cost for doing it in c++ using stl/boost (i.e. your so file might be a meg or two)
01:45 < dash> prell: fun!
01:45 < dash> prell: so i'm confused. why C++?
01:46 < pyn> <prell@efnet> dash: I've rewritten and optimized my code a few times, and I just can't get that sucker to be quick.
01:46 < dash> prell: Er. I mean, "Why not C"
01:46 < MFen> how can you tell if a directory has been ldconfig'd properly, other than linking against the libraries in there
01:46 < MFen> ?
01:46 < pyn> <prell@efnet> dash: Oh, well I'd be happy with C, but like I said, I would like the nicities of the STL (streams, etc)
01:46 < exarkun> kiko: If you're really returning -1, 0, or 1 consistently, cmp() should behave how you expect it to.
01:46 < dash> prell: Streams??
01:46 < dash> prell: Whatever for?
01:46 < pyn> <prell@efnet> dash: I know.. I know
01:46 < kiko> exarkun: my question is how does __cmp__ behave when the comparison is cmp(other, you)
01:46 < kiko> i.e.
01:46 < Erwin> prell: well, use the binascii module for ideas
01:46 < pyn> <prell@efnet> dash: ability to readline(), etc..
01:47 < kiko> cmp(1, me) versus cmp(me, 1)
01:47 < exarkun> kiko: "correctly" :)
01:47 < pyn> <prell@efnet> Erwin: binascii?
01:47 < dash> prell: python already _has_ those, dude
01:47 < kiko> exarkun: c'mon :-P
01:47 < Erwin> prell: yes, the C module that handles UU
01:47 < exarkun> kiko: if the other object does not implement a comparison function, python calls yours instead.
01:47 < pyn> <prell@efnet> dash: I think IO in python is part of my bottleneck
01:47 < kiko> exarkun: *ah*.
01:47 < dash> prell: hmm, then you're probably doing I/O wrong
01:47 < kiko> that's what I wanted to know
01:47 < pyn> <prell@efnet> Erwin: Is the code for that available?  I assume it's in C because it's so fast
01:48 < dash> prell: it is in the stdlib.
01:48 < pyn> <prell@efnet> dash:  Any tips?  I use readlines()
01:48 < kiko> exarkun: but then how does cmp(1, o) result differently than cmp(o, 1)?
01:48 < pyn> <prell@efnet> dash: Additionally, I use map() on the lines I read, then I string.join() the buffer and write it all at once
01:48 < exarkun> kiko: -
01:48 < dash> prell: i haven't looked at how binascii works, but i am betting it does it properly
01:49 < pyn> <prell@efnet> dash: I was wondering before if readlines() is buffering or something, waiting and only giving me characters when I ask for them?
01:49 < pyn> <prell@efnet> dash: I'll check it out.
01:49 < kiko> exarkun: sorry, *not* return differently. that's bad wording, i know :-)
01:49 < exarkun> kiko: I'd guess your __cmp__ is buggy.
01:49 < exarkun> kiko: Hard to say without seeing the code, though.
01:49 < dash> prell: readlines() reads the whole thing and then allocates a list containing each line as an element
01:50 < kiko> exarkun: can you stand 20 lines of privmsg?
01:50 < exarkun> kiko: no
01:50 < exarkun> kiko: #flood or a web page
01:50 < kiko> exarkun: #flood is fine :-)
01:50 < pyn> <prell@efnet> dash: Yeah.  Let me take a look at binascii and perhaps I could keep this in Python.  I have to say, I find it hard to believe that an otherwise damn-fast language would slow down here

02:48 < burp> rt: Savingss to the company?
02:48 < burp> rt: Or the mysterious step 2. ? that comes before step 3. Profit?
02:49 < stultus> Is this an Office Space-type scam?

02:50 < chrchr> rt: Neat.
02:51 < rt> trying to convince people to use python more :-)
02:51 < ALi`> hehe
02:51 < rt> we use way too many different tools to glue bits of a production together.
02:51 < dash> exarkun: why do you think that
02:51 < Zalamander> the only reason I learned python in the first place was because my boss wanted me too.
02:51 < chrchr> rt: Is it mostly C? What other tools do they use, I wonder?
02:51 < Erwin> rt: I guess you're the only one here that has his own entry on IMDB :)
02:52 < rt> Renderman was entirely C.  Most new development for tools is in C++.   Scripting and other glue bits are still perl, shell, and python.
02:52 < exarkun> dash: Because this year, the entries will run on a machine controlled by the author.

03:01 < bram> I'd like to avoid doing a full allocation of the memory if possible

03:01 < exarkun> 50
03:01 < exarkun> What do you mean?
03:01 < dash> exarkun: you used to be able to slice it!
03:01 < bram> huh, I thought that stopped working in python 2.2 or 2.3
03:01 < dash> for like a release and a half
03:02 < bram> I don't need slicing, just len() and indexing
03:02 < bram> do those still work?

03:10 < exarkun> hmm, these tracks are huge
03:10 < stultus> Why is this such a difficult problem now?

03:11 < SamB> however, at the moment, I've only got a 1500/3000 byte-per-second connection to it...
03:11 < exarkun> There are "physical" constraints on the path you can follow - your cars braking, turning, and acceleration characteristics
03:11 < chrchr> How is this even a progarmmering problem?
03:12 < Erwin> yeah, they are all 1024x768

20:47 < jacius> hey guys, a friend and I were discussing reasons why someone would want to to use C/C++ over Python, and one of the main reasons we came up with was: experience with C would be more useful in a large programming company, since they will probably be using C for their projects. Is there merit to this, or would experience with Python be as good as experience with C?
20:47 < kron3d> dash: thnx i'll get back to you...
20:49 < kron3d> jacius: it really depends on the company... although most stay with c or rather c++. a few are there that are capitalizing on python's development speed maybe not for their products, but for some house keeping chores
20:50 < dash> jacius: no, that's not a reason to want to use C
20:50 < dash> jacius: are you interested in writing good programs, or are you interested in getting a job with some random company? :)
20:50 < mind21_98> careers are overrated.
20:51 < dash> jacius: you can be both, of course, but it should be clear in your mind that they're distinct things :)
20:51 < jacius> heh
20:51 < dash> jacius: large programming companies usually do most things wrong
20:51 < jacius> well, some might consider having a job to be a good thing :P

21:30 < exarkun> simplify, don't over simplify
21:30 < dash> yes.
21:31 < exarkun> I suppose I can see how IndexedCatalog would work with this, though
21:31 < kiko> I was trying to explain in 10 lines the issue, and ended up realizing that it only works because IC stores the module name + class persistently, not the class itself.
21:31 < exarkun> But you are probably exploiting a bug in it, not a feature.
21:31 < kiko> somewhat true
21:31 < dash> kiko: then what you are doing is not what you told us you are doing

18:45 < Erwin> isinstance(object, list) will check whether object is of type list (or a subtype)

18:45 < fab31> nobody have an idea about my problem ? :(
18:45 < ThomasWaldmann> the moinmoin and moinmaster wiki is offline
18:45 < xirus> Erwin: ah ok thx
18:45 < Erwin> of course, that does not mean it does not support sequence ops. it could be a tuple, a string or a user-defined class.
18:45 < deltab> xirus: why do you want to know?
18:46 < xirus> well, to prevent an error, since i'll be working on a list but I'm not sure if it will actually be a list
18:46 < xirus> (it's given as a function argument)
18:47 < Erwin> "not sure" ?
18:47 < xirus> indeed
18:47 < Erwin> what does that mean?
18:48 < Erwin> that something generates random objects and calls your functions with them?
18:48 < bouil> lol
18:48 < xirus> that someone (or myself) could actually pass a string instead of a list, which would result in an error... I've always learned to check these things first
18:49 < hemkund> xirus: you have to have special handling for each type.
18:49 < xirus> what do you mean?
18:49 < Erwin> so what are you going to do when a string is passed?
18:49 < Erwin> other than raise an error, which means your program has a fault in it anyway
18:49 < xirus> return 0
18:49 < hemkund> you can check type(arg) to see if it's a list, if so handle one way otherwise handle another way
18:49 < microftxxx> kljsdfklasdj
18:50 < microftxxx> I can't get these damn images to load!
18:50 < Erwin> xirus: ouch.
18:50 < xirus> it's for a search function, I'll just say that I didn't found anything when a string is passed (and give a warning about this)
18:50 < microftxxx> I've tried them on canvases, I've tried them in labels... arg!
18:50 < Erwin> xirus: That is even worse. If your program has a program error it should not suppress it silently
18:50 < xirus> no, but i'll output a warning about this and the program will still be able to run
18:50 < xirus> (with a corrupted search function, but the rest will work)
18:51 < microftxxx> Label(root, image=ImageTk.PhotoImage(Image.open('myimage.gif'))) should work, right?
18:51 < slayne> fab31: What version of PIL are you using?
18:51 < slayne> microftxxx: no...
18:51 < slayne> microftxxx: there are image reference issues there
18:51 < fab31> hummm... checking
18:51 < hemkund> xirus: actually id does make sense, in python there is no overloading based on argument types, and sometimes you do want to hadle more than one type
18:51 < slayne> microftxxx: I always run into that problem
18:51 < Kengur> xirus: suppress it! beat it up silently and make it obey and behave itself!

18:52 < microftxxx> image reference issues?
18:52 < fab31> slayne: the one on the site, I hand-compilled it
18:52 < xirus> hemkund: yes that type(arg) is useful, but not in my situation, I only need a list (or typle)
18:52 < slayne> microftxxx: the label widget doesn't hold a reference to the image object, so after the Label() call is done, the image is deleted

20:20 < Pahan> drewp: I have a small collection of speed tests :P
20:20 < exarkun> dooms: so at that point it would be beneficial to know that the map solution involves 1 division and 1 function call per element
20:20 < dooms> well..
20:20 < Erwin> replace lambda x,y: x+y with operator.add
20:20 < exarkun> dooms: and the list comp involves 1 division per element
20:20 < drewp> Pahan: they are useless to me. i profile my own code with data that i claim is typical for my program
20:20 < Erwin> anyway, (2).__rdiv__ is about 150% faster on this machine
20:20 < bouil> Erwin: thanks, i have tried "add" but does'nt worked...
20:20 < dooms> time.clock usually has not a sufficient resolution and the overhead of profile does'nt give any guaranties here
20:21 < drewp> bouil: you can replace the whole reduce with a call to sum(), if you replace your python version with the new unreleased one :)
20:21 < Pahan> drewp: I am not offering them to you. These tests are indepedent of data -- most are similar to comparing speed of in-operator, dict.has_key and dict.setdefault.

21:19 < xirus> is there some function to 'compare' two lists and create a new list with the common elements in it?
21:20 -!- pi_complex [~Paride@193.51.83.12] has joined #python
21:20 < exarkun> xirus: [x for x in L1 if x in L2]
21:21 < Erwin> that's slow, however
21:21 < sjj> use sets
21:21 < exarkun> not for small L1 and L2!
21:21 < Erwin> with 2.3 you can do: Set(L1).intersection(Set(L2))
21:21 < sjj> Set(l1) & Set(l2)
21:21 < xirus> well I'm still on 2.2.3
21:22 -!- Zalamander [zal@cuodan.net] has joined #python
21:22 < exarkun> If you're looking for efficiency, sets are also not the answer
21:22 < Erwin> Don't sets use dictionaries internally?
21:22 < sjj> Erwin: yes
21:22 < exarkun> Yes, but they don't use them in the most efficient manner for this operation.
21:23 -!- TTimoAFK is now known as TTimo
21:23 < xirus> this set only works for 2.3?
21:23 < exarkun> xirus: yes
21:23 < sjj> the set module is only included with 2.3
21:23 < exarkun> xirus: How long are L1 and L2?
21:23 < DanUK> hi can anyone help me, how would i get a compiled (exe) app to run in the background with no gui? all i want to do is hide the app on a uni pc
21:23 < sjj> s/set/sets/
21:23 < exarkun> DanUK: Why do you want to hide it?
21:24 < xirus> exarkun: depends, it's still for my search function, so it can be a list with thousands of elements or just a few
21:24 < pyn> <jelmer@efnet> its probably a keylogger
21:24 < DanUK> do my teacher cant see it
21:24 < pyn> <jelmer@efnet> or a password cracker i bet
21:24 < xirus> exarkun: but prolly only few
21:24 < exarkun> DanUK: I think that is off-topic for #python.
21:24 < exarkun> DanUK: try #ypn

21:27 < Zalamander> exarkun yes, that is the road I'm on now
21:27 < njs> permutations or subsets?
21:27 < Pahan> Zalamander: Have a function that converts a number into a list of binary digits and iterate from 0 to 2**(len(original_list))
21:27 < Pahan> njs: He probably meant subsets.
21:27 < Zalamander> subsets? No

15:01 < farmer|CS> thanks
15:01 < moshez> mule: ok, sounds like you always take two lists
15:01 < moshez> mule: or more correctly, two iterables
15:02 < mule> some input types for an html form are better described by a list, some by a dict
15:02 < moshez> mule: huh?
15:02 < deltab> one dict?
15:02 < mule> well, it's just an example
15:02 < deltab> you mean a list of dicts?
15:02 < moshez> mule: you probably want to have two different methods in that case
15:03 < mule> moshez: yes, I probably do, but say if the two methods are very long and very similar
15:03 < moshez> mule: refactor common code into a function

15:08 < mule> so it's not harmful?
15:08 < deltab> or when?
15:08 < deltab> no
15:08 < Jerub> the only reason to use GET is if you want the user to be able to bookmark a page.
15:08 < mule> maybe a few weeks ago
15:08 < moshez> Jerub: no the other way around
15:08 < deltab> unless perhaps if you have a web server that crashes when it receives a question mark
15:08 < moshez> the only reason to use POST is if it's not idempotent
15:09 < deltab> Jerub: uh, what?!
15:09 < mule> well, I am doing something alltogether different :)
15:09 < mule> but I am allowed the ?
15:09 < Jerub> GET requests should be repeatable. the user should be able to paste the url to his friends, put it in his bookmarks, etc.
15:10 < deltab> yes - but those aren't the *only* reasons to use GET
15:10 < mule> so how to some sites have /cgi-bin/foo.cgi/parameters? they just parse the request before it gets to the webserver?

17:47 < radix> steveh: typically, you have a header like "content-length: N bytes" in your line-mode headers
17:47 < alankila> I guess you just need commands in your protocol to signal that
17:48 < radix> steveh: then the receiver reads N bytes
17:48 < alankila> yes, or exactly that, a length of non-line-oriented block that will follow
17:48 < radix> steveh: then it goes back to line mode after reading N bytes
17:48 < steveh> radix: you misunderstood me. I am using twisted's linereceiver to implement this, but that is not really pertinent to my question
17:48 < The-Fixer> or an empty "line"

17:53 < steveh> this is for managing access to a text buffer shared among multiple clients.
17:53 < radix> if you have length-prefixed raw mode, then you can have a completely arbitrary byte stream go over the wire, without worrying about escaping anything
17:53 < steveh> radix: that is probably the way to go
17:54 < radix> steveh: i'd probably do that in PB :-)
17:54 < steveh> well
17:54 < radix> i assume you mean like a shared editor buffer
17:54 < steveh> I used xmlrpc for one mockup, but I think constantly opening and closing connections killed responsiveness
17:54 < PenguinOfDoom> steveh: Make sure you optimize your client behavior to cache changes, otherwise you'll get a network hog on your hands.
17:55 < radix> for facilitating pair programming and such things
17:55 < steveh> but if PB doesn't make a new connection for each procedure call that might be something to look into
17:55 < radix> steveh: yes, that is a problem with xmlrpc, but not a problem with PB
17:55 < The-Fixer> just xmit the changes
17:55 < steveh> The-Fixer: way ahead of you
17:55 < steveh> :)
17:55 < radix> steveh: PB is a real protocol, not something hacked on top of HTTP :)
17:55 < steveh> I've got a basic model that should work, it's an implementation problem now
17:56 < alankila> is it a server-client model or some peer-to-peer kinda thing?
17:56 < radix> alankila: depends what you mean
17:56 < alankila> I guess the former
17:56 < radix> alankila: after the trivial handshake, the protocol is 100% symmetric
17:56 < alankila> ok
17:56 < PenguinOfDoom> steveh: Does your server verify client's copy of the buffer once in a while?
17:56 < alankila> that's more among the lines I was asking
17:57 < steveh> PenguinOfDoom: only one client is permitted to alter the changes at any given time
17:57 < steveh> PenguinOfDoom: any time an update is made, all clients are updated before more changes are accepted

17:59 < alankila> actually, I have no idea if pair programming is great & fun. Do you like it?
17:59 < radix> eh, it's a big stretch to call that pair programming :)
17:59 < radix> screen can facilitate it, though
17:59 < steveh> yeah, screen is nice

18:00 < steveh> that's the way i feel
18:00 < steveh> but others disagree
18:00 < radix> >:)
18:00 < radix> the biggest problem with pair programming is environments
18:01 < PenguinOfDoom> Yes!
18:01 < radix> it might be cool to use something like steveh's protocol, implemented for various different editors
18:01 < PenguinOfDoom> Humans should be less dependent on their position in space.
18:01 < radix> and you could use it even when you are physically close
18:01 < radix> so people can use vim and emacs, qwerty and dvorak
18:02 < alankila> I wonder if the locking should be made more finegrained to be actually good. But then again, I'm just spouting off my mouth not knowing anything about the issues.
18:02 < PenguinOfDoom> Ahh, pair programming using two computers?
18:02 < alankila> there's a single global lock now, which can be significant if the network is not most responsive
18:02 < radix> alankila: huh? if it's real-time, it's as fine-grained as it needs to be
18:02 < radix> ehh
18:02 < radix> you don't really need that much response
18:02 < steveh> I think I will investigate pb for version 0.2a. the explicit-size for raw data seems to be the way to go
18:03 < steveh> this first version only supports 6 operations anyway
18:03 < alankila> radix: maybe not. But I'm behind a doubly NATted network link and I really find that not even ssh session is fun through this. :(
18:03 < steveh> a prefab remote procedure solution would be more useful as the buffer gets more sophisticated
18:04 < radix> alankila: well, yes, but i don't think that's a relevant kind of latency
18:04 < radix> alankila: the biggest problem with that is *typing* latency
18:04 < radix> you'll hit a key and not see it for 3 seconds

18:04 < alankila> maybe not, but if the editor must stall when it receives an update until it has somehow coordinated that all other clients also get updated, then that sounds a bit dubious to me. Basically you need some kind of message-passing, akin to a ping, to ensure contents are synchronized before continuing, afaik.
18:05 < steveh> it depends on how the lock is implemented

18:05 < steveh> that's why I want a working prototype up, to see exactly where latency is a factor
18:05 < alankila> you're right though, if the protocol is intelligent, you indeed get seemingly zero latency for your own changes
18:05 < alankila> and then that will be great
18:05 < radix> steveh: *nod*
18:06 < pstickne> it seems like it would be a tremendous strain on the network... to have anything short of a much larger "filelock"
18:06 < radix> alankila: presumably, you can't even make local changes until you get a lock
18:06 < radix> pstickne: ??
18:06 < steveh> radix: that is right. i have a poorly-written wiki up on the subject
18:06 < alankila> however, if your own changes first require a synchronizing at the peer(s) to make sure the states of all buffers stay consistent, then you will get something less than adorable, I fear.
18:06 < radix> pstickne: this is *nothing at all* compared to, say, VoIP :)

18:09 < PenguinOfDoom> Why not simulate the exact screen -x latency semantics?
18:09 < radix> PenguinOfDoom: screen -x has many problems
18:09 < steveh> and it's a different problem
18:09 < radix> PenguinOfDoom: the biggest one being *there is no lock* :)

18:10 < PenguinOfDoom> radix: "get your dirty hands off the keyboard, I am typing stuff!!!1", you say into microphone!
18:10 < steveh> well, in my model lock semantics could be a preference
18:11 < steveh> in theory any time anyone touches a key their client would get the lock from the current holder
18:11 < PenguinOfDoom> steveh: Why?
18:11 < steveh> or you could have an explicit "unlock" button
18:11 < radix> PenguinOfDoom: actually, yeah
18:11 < PenguinOfDoom> Why not forgo locking at all?
18:11 < radix> PenguinOfDoom: that's how divmodders have been doing it
18:11 < steveh> either way the main point of the lock is preserved
18:11 < radix> VoIP + screen -x
18:11 < steveh> all buffers are always synchronized
18:12 < radix> PenguinOfDoom: forgoing locking is what screen -x does, and I just explained the problems with that
18:12 < steveh> PenguinOfDoom: the point of the lock is to maintain the invariant, not to prevent mistakes
18:12 < radix> actually, i didn't explain them too well
18:12 < radix> but you probably get the idea
18:12 < PenguinOfDoom> radix: Nope.
18:12 < PenguinOfDoom> radix: I seriously don't see what the problem is.
18:12 < radix> PenguinOfDoom: have you ever done pairing on a screen -x or a remote X or a VNC?

18:13 < steveh> there are two issues here: 1) a lock against people overwriting crap that you're doing. 2) a lock to maintain synchronization
18:13 < steveh> I _need_ a lock for 2)
18:13 < PenguinOfDoom> If two insert operations get sent at the same time, each of the players will see their own changes implemented (with zero latency) and then see the combination of changes after network latency time.
18:13 -!- daniel_ [daniel@pD9E6777A.dip.t-dialin.net] has quit [Connection timed out]
18:13 < steveh> 1) can be a settable preference that uses 2)
18:13 < radix> PenguinOfDoom: hah! _that_ is impossible
18:13 < PenguinOfDoom> In each case, they brought it upon themselves.
18:13 < radix> PenguinOfDoom: the changes will conflict
18:13 < PenguinOfDoom> And anyway, what would you do when lock is unavailable? Block?
18:14 -!- Jerub [jerub@bne-pri11-18-241.ecn.net.au] has joined #python
18:14 < radix> PenguinOfDoom: well, steveh said that he would like it to be a matter of preference
18:14 < alankila> the problem with conflicting changes is that you have to at least arbitrare the winner in those cases. The disaster is if the buffers go out of sync.
18:14 < radix> PenguinOfDoom: my preference would be "you can't type if you don't have the lock"
18:14 < steveh> PenguinOfDoom: depends. you could lock the editing window, or you could automatically get the lock when you type in the window.
18:14 < PenguinOfDoom> alankila: Server is authoritative, but clients can do their own clientside prediction.
18:14 < steveh> PenguinOfDoom: at worst there would be poor responsiveness when you first start typing
18:15 < PenguinOfDoom> Where prediction is "my changes are immediately implemented"
18:15 < steveh> PenguinOfDoom: that's waay too complicated
18:15 < radix> PenguinOfDoom: this isn't a game :-)
18:15 < PenguinOfDoom> radix: It IS a game.
18:15 < radix> PenguinOfDoom: no
18:15 < PenguinOfDoom> It has precisely the same semantics as a multiplayer game.
18:15 < radix> PenguinOfDoom: with a game that has zillions of updates per second, your prediction can be off
18:15 < radix> PenguinOfDoom: No!
18:15 < radix> PenguinOfDoom: code is strict
18:15 < steveh> alankila: that's pretty much why it must be a given that all buffers are always in sync
18:16 < PenguinOfDoom> radix: Shush. Games are strict, but local copies might get out of sync temporarily due to misprediction.
18:16 < steveh> there's not really any way to predict what anyone's going to do in editing
18:16 -!- KevinMarks [~Snak@h-69-3-247-240.SNVACAID.dynamic.covad.net] has joined #python
18:16 < steveh> so that's a non starter :)
18:16 < steveh> except for, of course, "nothing."
18:16 < PenguinOfDoom> steveh: That's why your prediction algorithm is "I am the only one typing";
18:17 < PenguinOfDoom> It's a very good algorithm. If you are both typing, it's a stupid case to handle.
18:17 < PenguinOfDoom> And if you are modifying different parts of the buffer, what do you care anyway?
18:17 < steveh> PenguinOfDoom: because indexes change when you modify different parts of the buffer.
18:18 < PenguinOfDoom> steveh: So transform indexes appropriately.
18:18 < steveh> PenguinOfDoom: YAGNI
18:18 < steveh> PenguinOfDoom: DTSTTCPW
18:18 < PenguinOfDoom> steveh: Again, what do you do when the lock is not available?
18:18 < PenguinOfDoom> And if your lock is going to flap a lot, is it really needed?
18:19 < PenguinOfDoom> And do you realize how slow a delay of 500 ms or so is?
18:19 < exarkun> YES
18:19 < steveh> PenguinOfDoom: Why in the world would the lock not be available?
18:19 < radix> exarkun: TELL HIM
18:19 < exarkun> LOCKING IS A REQUIREMENT FOR DATA INTEGRITY
18:19 < PenguinOfDoom> steveh: Because somebody else obtained it.
18:19 < alankila> they're just worried in keeping the bloody buffer in sync.
18:19 < steveh> PenguinOfDoom: If your network has latency of 500ms no solution will work.
18:19 < PenguinOfDoom> steveh: My network has latency of 250 ms.
18:19 < exarkun> BEFORE YOU INCREMENT THE POINTER YOU MUST ACQUIRE ITS WRITE LOCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
18:19 < radix> wow
18:19 < PenguinOfDoom> steveh: But your network needs to synchronize locking with at least 2 clients.
18:19 < alankila> you seem to think that you can just fix it up with some kind of big update afterwards, but the easiest (and maybe sanest) way is to ensrue the buffers never go out of sync, so you lock before you can do anything
18:19 < steveh> PenguinOfDoom: There would be a quarter-second delay before you see your typing on the screen.
18:20 < exarkun> alankila: ha ha
18:20 < steveh> PenguinOfDoom: At first. When you had the lock it would be instantaneous.

18:20 < PenguinOfDoom> steveh: Actually, one-second latency. You need to send lock request to server, it needs to negotiate lock with the other client and send response to you.
18:20 < radix> PenguinOfDoom: dude, have you done pair programming? :)
18:20 < PenguinOfDoom> radix: No!
18:20 < steveh> PenguinOfDoom: you didn't read my wiki. there is no server.
18:21 < radix> PenguinOfDoom: so you're arguing for a style of collaborative programming without any experience with it
18:21 < PenguinOfDoom> radix: Huh what? I am not arguing style. I am arguing shared buffer protocol implementation.
18:21 < radix> PenguinOfDoom: no, this has very large impacts on the style of collaborative programming
18:21 < PenguinOfDoom> steveh: Sounds network hoggy for more than 2 clients.
18:21 < PenguinOfDoom> Hrm.
18:21 < PenguinOfDoom> Or not.
18:22 < steveh> No
18:22 < radix> PenguinOfDoom: steveh's implementation allows for many preferences to be implemented
18:22 < radix> PenguinOfDoom: yours forces a particular one, and one that's _crappy_
18:22 < exarkun> preferences are bad
18:22 < steveh> There is an ad-hoc "server" -- the guy with the lock
18:22 < exarkun> fiat usually wins
18:22 < radix> exarkun: i only care about one preference, of course
18:22 < radix> but the one that PenguinOfDoom is arguing is the wrong one
18:22 < exarkun> moving the location of the lock is disasterous
18:22 < steveh> exarkun: this refers to interface preferences, not protocol preferences.
18:22 < exarkun> lock location discovery procedures are universally flawed
18:22 < PenguinOfDoom> steveh: How is the lock owner determined?
18:22 < exarkun> there is actually a proof of this
18:23 < steveh> PenguinOfDoom: when a buffer is created, the client who created the buffer has the lock. when other clients connect to this buffer, they can request the lock, and they will get it as soon as the buffers are synchronized.

18:23 < PenguinOfDoom> steveh: Is "request the lock" a UI option?
18:24 < steveh> PenguinOfDoom: the point at which the lock is requested can be. radix would want a separate button. others might want to automatically acquire the lock when something is typed in the window.
18:25 < steveh> in any case, there would be no more delay for getting the lock than there would be for any other operation
18:25 < PenguinOfDoom> steveh: What happens when lock request is denied, in the second case?
18:25 -!- Evolux [darkfusion@212.144.203.236] has quit ["leaving"]
18:25 < radix> And when the lock is acquired, it would be converted to a "Pass lock" button :-)
18:25 < steveh> PenguinOfDoom: a client using that interface probably wouldn't ever have an explicit denial of a lock request
18:25  * PenguinOfDoom throws a flag at radix backwards.
18:26 < exarkun> steveh: That wasn't his question.
18:26 < PenguinOfDoom> steveh: So what, the new changes will mysteriously disappear?
18:26 < steveh> PenguinOfDoom: no, you'd never get to make those changes.
18:26 < Cwiiis> God, I only appreciate how great python is after being forced to use Java at uni :/
18:27 < steveh> PenguinOfDoom: since you don't have the lock.
18:27 < exarkun> steveh: You are contradicting yourself.
18:27 < radix> PenguinOfDoom: In my preference, the UI would not allow the user to type stuff in when someone else has the lock
18:27 < exarkun> steveh: If I implicitly acquire the lock on a buffer by typing into that buffer, what happens if that buffer is already locked?
18:27 < PenguinOfDoom> radix: Yeah, I don't see any obvious problems with your solution.
18:27 < radix> PenguinOfDoom: it could still be implemented otherwise, though
18:28 < radix> like, you could make changes without acquiring the lock
18:28 < PenguinOfDoom> radix: Yes! screen -x style!
18:28 < radix> and when you finally did, it could do something similar to cvs merge
18:28 < radix> PenguinOfDoom: No
18:28 < steveh> exarkun: no, there are separate issues here. PenguinOfDoom is talking about a degenerate case where one client is implementing forced-lock-acquisition semantics and the lock holder is not implementing it.
18:28 < steveh> exarkun: the behavior there is undefined :)
18:28 < exarkun> Your system is broken then.
18:28 < radix> Nah
18:28 < steveh> exarkun: no.
18:28 < radix> you would have an option in the program
18:28 < radix> "automatically pass lock when requested"
18:28 < steveh> exarkun: most likely "the buffer is already locked"
18:28 < exarkun> steveh: I already typed stuff.
18:28 < radix> and also "automatically request lock when I try to type something"
18:29 < exarkun> steveh: Where does it go?
18:29 < radix> exarkun: cvs merge!

18:29 < exarkun> bye
18:29 < steveh> exarkun: but it won't be sent over the wire til the lock is received

18:30 < PenguinOfDoom> radix: Also, peer-to-peer is suck unless you are a p2p luminary.
18:30 < radix> uggg
18:31  * PenguinOfDoom throws in some NAT issues.
18:31 < PenguinOfDoom> See, you want a server.
18:31 < steveh> PenguinOfDoom: but the setup I am envisioning would not even display what you've typed into the GUI widget's buffer (sent as events) until it was added to the shared buffer
18:32 < PenguinOfDoom> steveh: Added in some indetermined time at which you will finally manage to obtain the lock.
18:32 < PenguinOfDoom> Lag lag lag.
18:32 < radix> PenguinOfDoom: whatever, what does the TCP server thing is trivially irrelevant
18:32 < PenguinOfDoom> radix: That has no grammar.
18:32 < steveh> PenguinOfDoom: well, this is why I am implementing a simple version. Lag could in theory be a problem, but you haven't proved that yet. :)
18:33 < radix> PenguinOfDoom: roar
18:33 < steveh> I can't see how it would be any more of a problem than with any other real-time-ish network application
18:33 < radix> PenguinOfDoom: TCP server/client issues are trivially irrelevant
18:33 < PenguinOfDoom> steveh: Depending on your locking semantics, grabbing a lock can take several round-trip intervals.
18:33 < radix> PenguinOfDoom: you just need to require one party to be able to accept connections
18:33 < radix> that's not much to ask
18:33 < PenguinOfDoom> radix: And then what, proxy data through that party?
18:34 < radix> PenguinOfDoom: right, but in the sane client configuration, the round trips are not a problem
18:34 < PenguinOfDoom> radix: Explain.
18:34 < radix> PenguinOfDoom: lock acquiring won't happen often
18:34 < steveh> yes
18:34 < steveh> you are optimizing a rare case
18:34 < PenguinOfDoom> argh
18:34 < PenguinOfDoom> Why use a lock at all if it is not needed?
18:34 < radix> a case that is basically useless for real pair programming
18:34 < radix> PenguinOfDoom: WHAT?
18:34 < radix> PenguinOfDoom: you are brain damaged
18:34 < PenguinOfDoom> radix: THERE IS NO RESOURCE CONTENTION
18:35 < steveh> PenguinOfDoom: it is needed to guarantee that all buffers are synchronized.
18:35 < steveh> PenguinOfDoom: there is a synchronization issue.
18:35 < PenguinOfDoom> gragh my model is betterer than yours.
18:35 < steveh> well, let's see
18:35 < PenguinOfDoom> Designate Alice as the server. She has the authoritative copy.
18:35 < steveh> you can implement yours
18:35 < steveh> and I'll implement mine
18:35 < steveh> and we'll see
18:35 < radix> PenguinOfDoom: your model is based on incorrect perceptions of what this kind of thing is useful for
18:35 < steveh> you might be right
18:35 < PenguinOfDoom> I have stuff to implement already.
18:35 < steveh> :)
18:35 < PenguinOfDoom> I am too lazy!
18:36 < radix> heh
18:36 < steveh> all copies are authoritative
18:36 < PenguinOfDoom> radix: So, how are you going to implement routing through the TCP connection topology?
18:36 < PenguinOfDoom> pee-too-pee is not trivial
18:36 < steveh> PenguinOfDoom: it doesn't need to be hugely scalable at this point.
18:36 < radix> PenguinOfDoom: this doesn't need to be that kind of p2p
18:37 < steveh> PenguinOfDoom: there's a reason it's called "pair" programming :)
18:37 < PenguinOfDoom> radix: steveh wiki talks about four-person case.
18:37 < PenguinOfDoom> You at least need to determine who connects to whom.
18:37 < steveh> that was just to show that it works for more than 2
18:37 < radix> PenguinOfDoom: yes, so?
18:37 < steveh> that is true
18:37 < radix> PenguinOfDoom: everybody connects to one participant
18:37 < radix> that's the only sane way to do it
18:38 < PenguinOfDoom> radix: Why not separate client part from the server part, then?
18:38 < radix> PenguinOfDoom: yeah, that's probably a good idea
18:38 < PenguinOfDoom> SEE, I TOLD YOU
18:38 < radix> PenguinOfDoom: there's no reason for this to be anything at all resembling p2p
18:38 < PenguinOfDoom> radix: I TOLD YOU THAT TOO
18:38 < radix> i didn't argue it
18:39 < radix> i don't even remember it being an issue
18:39 < PenguinOfDoom> I see you and steveh as some evil combined entity trying to convince me of strange things.

18:44 < steveh> they are even implemented in hardware sometimes :)
18:45 < PenguinOfDoom> radix: Explain, why is there an inherent need to prevent other participants from modifying the buffer? If the system comes into a stable state (all buffer copies are synchronized) within small time, why is synchronization relevant?
18:45 < radix> PenguinOfDoom: because screen -x is a PITA
18:46 < PenguinOfDoom> radix: You haven't explained problems with screen -x compared to my approach!
18:46 < radix> PenguinOfDoom: you're required to have out-of-band communication to tell people not to type because they're writing a function
18:46 < steveh> PenguinOfDoom: the simplest way to ensure the system comes into a synchronized state is to lock the buffer.
18:47 < PenguinOfDoom> radix: You are required to have out-of-band communication to discuss who gets to edit next.
18:47 < radix> PenguinOfDoom: No
18:47 < PenguinOfDoom> radix: In BOTH cases, that isd.
18:47 < radix> PenguinOfDoom: You have a button that says "acquire lock"

18:47 < PenguinOfDoom> radix: Yes. What if you and me both click it?
18:47 < PenguinOfDoom> While steveh has the lock!
18:47 < radix> PenguinOfDoom: the lock-holder decides who to give it to

18:49 < radix> steveh: he's talking about "discussion" about deciding who gets the next lock
18:49 < steveh> more of an interface implementation issue
18:49 < radix> PenguinOfDoom: then you go back to good old out-of-band communication
18:49 < radix> PenguinOfDoom: alternatively, lock-holder uses fiat decision
18:49 < radix> :)
18:49 < PenguinOfDoom> radix: See, so your issue is irrelevant.

18:50 < radix> PenguinOfDoom: the worst case is the same: out-of-band communication
18:50 < PenguinOfDoom> How does it improve the common case?
18:50 < radix> PenguinOfDoom: the very much common case is improved: two people. lockholder passes to other person when he's ready to.
18:51 < Gujin> what can be used as NULL in python?
18:51 < steveh> None
18:51 < Gujin> ok thanks
18:51 < PenguinOfDoom> radix: Ugh. Tell me, why are we optimizing for lack of out-of-band communication?
18:52 < PenguinOfDoom> That's terminally stupid.
18:52 < radix> PenguinOfDoom: we're are optimizing for lack of inefficiencies
18:52 < radix> PenguinOfDoom: and it formalizes who really has typing rights
18:52 < PenguinOfDoom> So it's an evil tyranny of the lockholder.
18:52 < steveh> well, that's what YOU'RE doing :0
18:52 < radix> PenguinOfDoom: and simulates *real* pair-programming, where both programmers use the same computer, more closely
18:53 < steveh> I'm just trying to make sure everyone has an up-to-date copy of the buffer at all times
18:53 < PenguinOfDoom> Hahahaha you are locked in with your outdated models.
18:53 < PenguinOfDoom> I am freed by my ignorance.
18:53 < radix> PenguinOfDoom: even in cases where there is casual, easy out-of-band communication, there can be annoyances

18:56 < Gujin> now the problem is that I need to have multiple widgets and I can't use the same name for all of them, any suggestions?
18:56 < radix> PenguinOfDoom: pair programming is about focusing on the same code

18:56  * PenguinOfDoom flies in circles around radix on the wings of ignorance.
18:56 < radix> PenguinOfDoom: if they're making unrelated changes, they might as well be using CVS and hacking in their local unshared emacs buffers

19:12 < PenguinOfDoom> erm

19:12 < rolemodel> is it just me, or the python interface is hauntingly similar to C++ console?

19:13 < steveh> radix: it seems to me though, that integrating with an event-based GUI model is much more easily done by an event-based networking model :)
19:13 < rolemodel> conversions and all that.
19:14 < radix> steveh: Yep!
19:14 < rolemodel> when i came to work on python, it felt a little bit like that, except no more compiling.
19:14 < steveh> so I should really get a big win out of twisted and python

20:19 < radix> moshez: and people build their own campaigns, serve them on their cable modems for the friends, sthings like that
20:19 < radix> there's even dungeon mastering, etc
20:20 < alankila> corecode: maybe there's nothing to be done so select goes waiting?
20:20 < moshez> cool
20:20 < radix> it's all based on D&Dv3, or something like that
20:20 < alankila> or what do you mean
20:20 < deltab> waxmop: IDLE uses Tkinter itself, and the objects you created became part of it

20:20 < moshez> radix: I'm not terribly interested in people hosting their own campaigns
20:20 < jimsteri> hello
20:20 < radix> moshez: Basically, any world where "change" is meaningful to anything other than short-term battle strategy, I consider an RPG :)
20:20 < moshez> radix: but hrm
20:20 < corecode> alankila: you mean, it waits forever because i specified the time the wrong way. and then something happens on stdin and it stops waiting...
20:20 < radix> moshez: (re: not an RPG)
20:20 < corecode> could actually be
20:20 < waxmop> aha! so, how do i create a separate window that i can work on?
20:21 < moshez> radix: ah, ok
20:21 < alankila> corecode: yep, just thought
20:21 < moshez> radix: yuo are like me! with strange definitions
20:21 < radix> moshez: hehe
20:21 < alankila> I think stdin is normally line buffered so you don't get data until complete line is given
20:21 < radix> moshez: yeah, i realized that is a pretty strange definition
20:21 < deltab> waxmop: which meant whatever your code did could affect IDLE (quit it or whatever)
20:21 < radix> moshez: but I think it's a useful classification
20:21 < moshez> radix: I think of my game as tactics/strategy combo
20:21 < xetrex> Hi, how can I load my own text to wxPython demo's wxHtmlWindow? In code there is "self.html.LoadPage(name)" to load from file, how can I insert my own text (read from db) there?
20:21 < corecode> wow
20:21 < corecode> that works really
20:21 < corecode> foo = lambda x: foo(x)
20:21 < deltab> waxmop: so now they've been separated
20:21 < corecode> hell
20:21 < alankila> corecode: it's really not much different from "def foo(x): foo(x)"
20:22 < corecode> yea :)
20:22 < radix> moshez: actually, maybe that's what I should just start calling a "virtual world"
20:22 < deltab> waxmop: use your own mainloop
20:22 < waxmop> deltab i don't understand.  I'll quit and restart idle, then what do i do?
20:22 < radix> because it's the type of game that I care about when I say "VW"

20:23 < waxmop> gotcha.
20:23 < radix> moshez: Heh :)
20:24 < waxmop> deltab: so, can you explain to me again what i should do in a brand-new idle session?
20:24 < radix> moshez: tell glyph to give me money to live so I can hack on it
20:24 < jimsteri> :(
20:24 < deltab> waxmop: use mainloop
20:24 < alankila> jimsteri: it normally goes like this: script outputs commands to STDOUT which get written to file or executed by the shell in unix
20:25 < jimsteri> so i cant get python to write commands to dos promt automaticly:P
20:25 < alankila> something like $(foobar.py) where foobar.py is now free to emit whatever shell commands it wants and they get executed by the shell. No idea if that can be done in ms-dos.
20:25 < waxmop> deltab: like this:  >>> cc = Tkinter.Canvas(None); cc.pack(); cc.mainloop(); #then, i no longer can do anything to the cc.

20:30 < Yhg1s> waxmop: IDLE is not the ideal interactive Tk environment, because it uses Tk itself :P
20:31 < waxmop> yeah, i meant from the python shell inside idle. well, i guess I'll just have to learn to debug my tk stuff some other way.  how do y'all do it?  write it in a editor, then run it?
20:31 < alankila> the proper solution would be to have an event-driven framework for inputting commands to a living Tk application

20:36 < virus_> jimsteri: sure, but it will probably not that successful as most windows wheenies don't have a python interpreter installed and will not want to run an unknown python script anyways.
20:36 < virus_> waxmop: well, it will require a person stupid enough to execute that script without having a short look at the code.
20:37 < alankila> and you can't make it spread automatically because it'd need a network service that's done in python and pretty ubiquitous

20:40 < alankila> it's true though. Java can jit nowadays on many platforms and the code speed is pretty good. Memory requirements have always been horrible though and are similar yet.
20:40 < alankila> At least according to the programming language shootout...
20:41 < virus_> alankila: well. it's not that bad anymore. Just compare Eclipse with any IDE of your choice.
20:41 < virus_> Features/Memory requirements is almost constant.
20:42 < virus_> s/constant/the same/
20:42 < alankila> well, I just know that any stuff we do with j2ee or struts is always a real memory hog
20:42 < alankila> never mind what it does, the processes are huge and for some reason always leak memory
20:42 < alankila> don't know where the problem is
20:42 < virus_> alankila: just set the heap right and you'll be able to half/third the memory requirements.

22:24 < jolsen> weird question from a new python programmer: how would i go about accepting input from a fifo while also looping through some set of operations?
22:24 < wols> jolsen: I'm no python dev either, but I would say: threads
22:25 < jolsen> i was told to stay away from threads

22:25 < PenguinOfDoom> jolsen: Twisted!
22:25 < drewp> jolsen: you want to occasionally check if there's new input, and read that new input, right?
22:25 < jolsen> drewp: yep
22:25 < PenguinOfDoom> wols: Please, do not tell people to use threads.
22:26 < wols> PenguinOfDoom: why not?
22:26 -!- jimsteri [~dont@dsl-XVIII-22.kotikaista.weppi.fi] has joined #python
22:26 < exarkun> wols: because they are typically not the correct answer.
22:26 < wols> any special way why threads in ypthon are not good?
22:26 < jolsen> drewp: but i also will have some loops going on at the same time doing ops every 10 mins or so
22:26 < jimsteri> hello <gain
22:26 < exarkun> wols: threads for concurrent IO isn't good in any language.
22:26 <@dash> wols: same reason not to use them in other languages
22:26 < jolsen> wols: i was todl python threads are nasty
22:26 < exarkun> (kernel threads, anyway)
22:26 < PenguinOfDoom> dash: But Erlang!
22:26 <@dash> wols: they rarely solve the problem you want to solve
22:27 <@dash> PenguinOfDoom: not kernel threads!
22:27 <@dash> wols: and they make your program slower and more complicated
22:27 < PenguinOfDoom> dash: Ha ha.
22:27 < Sinistrad> what is an alternative solution to threading?
22:27 <@dash> Sinistrad: to what problem?
22:27 < PenguinOfDoom> Sinistrad: Not using threads.
22:27 < jolsen> so how does one do something like i am trying to do? i.e. block on a fifo yet loop through a set of instructions at the same time.
22:28 < drewp> jolsen: don't block

22:28 <@dash> no
22:28 < jolsen> ok..
22:28 < exarkun> well, yes.
22:28 < exarkun> you could also do it with asynchronous APIs, which is better, but a bit harder
22:28 < jolsen> i wish i could find a good example
22:29 < PenguinOfDoom> Asynch-what? They don't exist!
22:29 < Sinistrad> well,  the only time I ever used threads was when writing a network server type of thing - it would take connections, creating a thread for each one (geh, details are fuzzy on what I was doing, that was four years ago...)
22:29 < exarkun> jolsen: Twisted!
22:29 <@dash> wols: the only python-specific thread issue is that only one thread can run python bytecode at a time
22:29 < jolsen> i was unable to find many examples with fifo

13:40 < freexm> squire: don't use wxPython, in my opinion tkinter is far more better

14:07 < Yhg1s> like syntax, and type and object semantics.
14:07 < squire> karan: have you programmed before ?
14:07 < karan> squire: nope
14:08 < bgs84> freexm: you want two buttons in the same row?
14:08 < karan> aum: would it compile in windows and/or macosx ?
14:08 < karan> or interpret rather

14:08 < bgs84> take a frame, and attach it 2 chiled labels

14:08 < karan> Yhg1s: ah true

14:11  * bgs84 think in reverse a lot...:-)
14:11 < Yhg1s> thinking in reverse is a useful skill.
14:11 < Yhg1s> you need it for event driven programming in general.

14:12 < Yhg1s> bgs84: you don't program math, you solve math.
14:13 < Yhg1s> and for people new to programming, who are used to telling the computer (by way of clicks or commands or whatever) "Do this, then do this, then do this", thinking in reverse can be quite a leap.
14:14 < Yhg1s> Normally, the act of catching a bus is "wait for the bus, hop on it, get your ticket stamped, and show your ticket to the driver"
14:14 -!- hyphenated [caleb@210.54.151.236] has quit ["see ya"]
14:15 < Yhg1s> in GUIs (and event-driven environments in general) it becomes "do "Hop in bus" when the bus arrives. do "stamp ticket" when entered the bus. do "show ticket to driver" when driver asks for it."
14:15 < Yhg1s> and then "wait until something happens"
14:17 < bgs84> wow!

21:11 < fxn> lament: the foo method can receive a block of code, when it is called the code is substituted where "yield" is read in the source (conceptually)
21:12 < lament> Well, in python you can just pass a function to another function.
21:12 < lament> And call that function.
21:12 < fxn> lament: you could say foo { code_of_any_complexity } and get it called, that's interesting when yield is surrounded by more code of course

21:14 < exarkun> freexm: you don't need coding: ...
21:14 < radix> fxn: () can be stuck on the end of any object, and it will try to call the object
21:14 < exarkun> freexm: all that lets you do is include encoded unicode in string literals in your source files.
21:15 < exarkun> fxn: doesn't ruby have functions?

22:12 < xlordt> no i just want it to answer on a channel string
22:12 < Fazer> xlordt: Explain more pleas.e
22:12 < Fazer> channel string?
22:12 < xlordt> ya
22:12 < xlordt> like..
22:12 < xlordt> if someone says.. sup
22:12 < Fazer> use PRIVMSG
22:13 < xlordt> i am
22:13 < xlordt> see
22:13 < deltab> http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/rfc/
22:13 < Fazer> there we go
22:13 < xlordt> ohh wait.. i deleted that part.. arg
22:13 < xlordt> kk thanx deltab
22:13 < exarkun> Fazer: What do you think you're using right now?
22:13 < Fazer> you spelled "receive" wrong in your code btw, xlordt :P
22:13 < Fazer> or however it's spelled
22:13 < Fazer> exarkun: What?
22:13 < exarkun> Fazer: PRIVMSG.
22:13 < xlordt> Fazer: i know.. i wanted it that way
22:13 < Fazer> I know
22:14 < Fazer> exarkun: EVerything is done using that...
22:14 < Fazer> :Fazer!~fazer@ACD39AE6.ipt.aol.com PRIVMSG #arson :w00t

22:14 < xlordt> hm
22:14 < exarkun> xlordt: Why not use an irc module?
22:14 < xlordt> exarkun: im going ot =)
22:14 < xlordt> to*
22:14 < Fazer> It makes you leet if you make your own :P
22:15 < exarkun> Fazer: Yes.  Where "leet" means "stupid".
22:15 < deltab> I recommend reading the protocol spec first, then using a module someone's already written and debugged
22:15 < Fazer> Exactly!
22:15 < xlordt> hehe.. i made it in c, the same way in python.. diffrent arg.. i will use the irc modules then
22:15 < Fazer> Okay
22:15 < Fazer> I didn't use any modules, I wanted to make my own.
22:15 < Fazer> And it's working pretty well now.
22:15 < Fazer> oh and btw
22:16 < Fazer> xlordt: YOu also have to think of ping time outs
22:16 < xlordt> ya i know
22:16 < Fazer> you have to "PONG" when you get a "PING"
22:16 < Fazer> and what not
22:16 < xlordt> i was tring to send it.. before
22:16 < xlordt> wasnt working neither
22:16 < Fazer> xlordt: It's all in the RFC
22:16 < xlordt> ya
22:16 < xlordt> reading
22:16 < Fazer> Good
22:16 < Mondragon> the rfc doesn't reflect most modern servers, unfortunately..
22:16 < exarkun> also, "the" rfc is misleading

22:36 < Fazer> love it when that happens

22:38 < freexm> mIRC IS freeze
22:39 < Fazer> okay
22:39 < freexm> why not use something like xchat as my self? or something like bitchx
22:41 < Fazer> bitchx is nice
22:41 < Fazer> mirc is faster on my machine than xhcat
22:41 < Fazer> so mIRC wins
22:41 < plaisthos> hi there
22:41 < Fazer> miRC isn't that bad
22:41 < Fazer> hai plaisthos
22:41 < e-gone> hehe
22:42 < plaisthos> or erc
22:42 < freexm> Fazer: well, it's all about taste ;)
22:42 < e-gone> mIRC is like running backdoor orifice with irc-plugin.. HEHE
22:42 < plaisthos> has anyone done ssl with python sockets?
22:42 < exarkun> yes
22:43 < plaisthos> but you only tell me to use twisted if I ask how to use them %)
22:43  * exarkun shrugs
22:43 < exarkun> don't ask if you don't want to ask
22:43 < freexm> when i hade mirc i got about 100 port scans per a hour, but with xchat, quite none - i don't know what made it but i stay with xchat :)
22:43 < plaisthos> I just want to know if socket.ssl is only for client ssl or if a server that implements ssl can use it too
22:44 < Fazer> :0-/
22:44 < exarkun> it's only for clients.
22:44 < plaisthos> :/
22:44 -!- natea_ [~natea@faelles.dhcp.dpu.dk] has joined #python
22:44 < itamar> for server you want pyopenssl
22:44 < seberino> freexm: are you worried about irc app being a security risk?
22:44 < itamar> and really, twisted
22:44 < plaisthos> %)
22:44 < plaisthos> i will look into both
22:44  * Sinistrad loves twisted, for some reason.
22:45 < itamar> cause using pyopenssl directly isn't totally trivial
22:45 < exarkun> why do it the easy way, though?
22:45 < freexm> seberino: yes and a lot
22:45 < plaisthos> easy way?
22:45 < plaisthos> not using ssl? :)
22:45 < exarkun> if "it" is "ssl sockets", then I don't see how "not using ssl" is any kind of solution.
22:45 < seberino> freexm: i started leaving xchat on all the time and was concerned too
22:46 < exarkun> "the easy way" would be to use Twisted
22:46 < exarkun> but you seem to have something against that
22:46 < seberino> freexm: people seem more hopeful about cracking a windoze box than a linux box i guess
22:46 < plaisthos> exarkun: the fact that I have to rewrite my project  (lazyness) or to use a crude hack
22:47 < radix> plaisthos: your project must be _full_ of crude hacks by now
22:47 < freexm> seberino: i know, i'm going to install red hat or gentoo about day or so
22:47 < radix> plaisthos: because i see you talking about how you decide to just use a crude hack instead of Twisted _constantly_ :)
22:47 < plaisthos> radix: it always the same crude hack %)
22:47 < plaisthos> but often I decide against it %)
22:48 < plaisthos> so it is not yet in my project :]
22:48 < radix> heh, ok
22:48  * radix brb!
22:49 < plaisthos> the hack replacing twisted _select method %)
22:49 < exarkun> at some point, you will have exerted more energy trying to decide whether to use Twisted or not than it would have taken to just use Twisted
22:50 < plaisthos> I think I will slowly move to twisted
22:50 < Sinistrad> slowly, like a mime in a box.
22:51 < plaisthos> mime?
22:51  * plaisthos goes looking the word up in a dictonary
22:52 < Sinistrad> plaisthos, I take it english is not your native language? :)
22:53 < plaisthos> Sinistrad: right
22:53  * plaisthos is a german guy with a bad english module
22:54 < plaisthos> wow 1 out of 6 links from localhost/doc/twisted-doc worked!
22:55 < plaisthos> and the working one is uninteresting
