23:11 < rik> interestingly, if you switch on the optimizer, you lose the guarentee of in-order evaluation of &&'s and stuff, so it can happen.
23:11 < rik> it've seen it happen too. it's very funny when people rely on it.
23:11 < quotemaster> No..
23:11 < quotemaster> That's a bug.

11:46 < IanH> hendry, it's called an array, as durnew said.
11:46 < durnew> which can be treated as an x,y table
11:46 < IanH> hendry, a C book is very useful when programming in C.

11:48 < durnew> can dyslexia form later in life? :P

19:38 < hendry> er... Ok, I am trying to understand. I want to simply pass that 2-dim array around to be populated by compute_goto
19:38 < hendry> and g would be used by several other functions. Is using pointers the best way to share a datastructure?
19:39 < hendry> q[mrw]: i thought I need a memset to clear the mem, so I can easily find out if if there has been a value set.
19:40 < hendry> yrlnry: isn't an int** a int[][], which g is? don't understand : (int [ROW])* . Could you please tell me what it should be?
19:40 < q[mrw]> hendry: assign {0} to it.
19:40 < yrlnry> hendry: No.

19:41 < Cybermorphic> It was a couple hours ago.
19:41 < yrlnry> hendry: And I don't think I can explain in detail on IRC; sory.
19:41 < arize> Cybermorphic: I'm here. erwin is afk
19:41 < Cybermorphic> Cool
19:42 < Cybermorphic> So what do you think about my question? If it is possible to emulate an entire computer system on a computer system to the point where you could manage and store virtual files within the emulated system?
19:42 < hendry> yrlnry: do you have some example at least ? ( i am pretty desperate to get this working )
19:43 < yrlnry> hendry: Give me a minute
19:44 < arize> Cybermorphic: the question is incomplete since the 'if' statement is left without operator and answer definitions.
19:44 < Cybermorphic> A computer inside a computer. That is the patent I have been reading about. The purpose of it is to trap viruses. You create a virtual computer to trick and release viruses into, to see if it causes damages.
19:44 < Cybermorphic> That why you can catch viruses even if you don't know there signatures
19:45 < Cybermorphic> Just by automaticly analyzing damages to the virtual computer system.
19:46 < Cybermorphic> Well even if I don't ask a well formed question, might you still have a helpfull answer?
19:46 < arize> Cybermorphic: Hmm... The only thing you'd do is to reinvent the wheel. Anti-Virus programs that run in daemonmode check for 'malicious' code
19:47 < Cybermorphic> Ooh really?
19:47 < arize> Cybermorphic: which is what you'd want the analysis program to do.
19:47 < Cybermorphic> What is daemonmode?
19:47 < arize> Cybermorphic: backgrounded.
19:47 < Cybermorphic> backgrounded?
19:48 < hksdu> Cybermorphic: ftp daemon means ftp server running in the background.

19:48 < Cybermorphic> I use windows too though, but right now I am on linux.
19:48 < Cybermorphic> Can a virus get around daemonmod by changing its own code around?

19:49 < hksdu> lol
19:49 < arize> Cybermorphic: the apps in the lower right of the windows taskbar are most likely daemons that wait for certain things to happen so they can take certain actions.
19:50 < arize> Cybermorphic: if I were you I'd give up coding an emulator if you don't know this much....
19:50 < Cybermorphic> Well I am familiar with the term: daemon
19:50 < Cybermorphic> But not what daemon mode does in terms of antivirus software.

19:52 < wcstok> novelty?
19:52 < arize> Cybermorphic: daemon mode is just what I told you. An underlying process waiting for certain things to happen before it takes action. I can imagine the anti-virus daemons hooks certain interrupts and checks their function codes before they are allowed to execute.
19:53 < Chunky> afaik, its file-io
19:53 < Chunky> so they can examine files as they are loaded/executed
19:53 < arize> Chunky: whatever. It still has to check the interrupts and the function codes.
19:53 < Cybermorphic> So basicly daemon mode watches to see if anything malicious happens inside the computer incase they didn't catch a known virus before it was executed.

21:05 < orbitz> you coudl make inline function
21:05 < PoppaVic> whoa - wait - try that again, justin?
21:05 < PoppaVic> I'm trying to cobble up a datafile totally sans code - about 10 lines, orbitz ;-)
