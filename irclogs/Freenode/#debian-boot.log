18:18 < joeyh> any powerpc people here?
18:19 < joeyh> or Marvin--?
18:19 < Marvin--> I'm no stinkin' powerpc person :)
18:20 < joeyh> so, build unhorked yet?
18:20 < Marvin--> libc6 is on hold, so my build script's apt-get upgrade didn't help
18:20 < Marvin--> I'm doing apt-get install libc6 in the chroot now
18:20 < joeyh> it's weird, I did a build_all yesterday w/o dep breakage, and my system is a week ond stable
18:21 < Marvin--> There, now it should have 2.3.2.ds1-9
18:21 < Marvin--> let me re-run the build script
18:22  * joeyh is puzzled
18:22 < Marvin--> I may not be home when it's finished since I'm going to a roleplaying session in a few minutes
18:22 < joeyh> I changed a file last night, and cvs does not notice it
18:22 < Marvin--> err
18:22 < joeyh> /di-utils-shell.templates/1.16/Thu Oct 16 20:44:46 2003//
18:34 < Marvin--> the build seems to have worked
18:34 < Marvin--> I'm off
18:34 < joeyh> cool, now I only need pester the cd people :-)

19:22 < Sesse> somebody complained about languagechooser, yes
19:23 < joeyh> fail how? Not be displayed?
19:23 < joeyh> I saw something like that last night, but it did not seem reproducible
19:28 < pere> languagechooser seem to work just fine, but I am thrown back to the main menu.

19:35 < joeyh> pere: I plan on doing some clean up of the d-i web site if you don't mind
19:35 < pere> I do not mind. :)
19:35 < joeyh> I've found it realy hard to find some common links, plan to reorganise a bit
19:35 < joeyh> ah, manty!
19:35 < pere> the site is just thrown together. :)
19:36 < joeyh> manty: i386 daily builds are working again, could you rev the cdrom?
19:36 < pere> After it was moved to www.d.o, I never took the time to update it.
19:36 < pere> (not that I updated it much before it moved either...:)
19:36 < joeyh> alastair has been doing good work on the ports page
19:36 < joeyh> although I have to turn on color in my browser to use it
19:37 < pere> :)
19:37 < manty> joeyh: weren't them working?
19:37 < joeyh> (the web looks ... weird in color after 1 year w/o)
19:37 < manty> joeyh: I believe yesterday everything was fine
19:37 < manty> :-?
19:37 < joeyh> manty: they're working fine, but they do not include the last 3 days of changes
19:37 < manty> ah
19:37 < manty> no problem
19:37 < joeyh> actually, you might copy current to working before updating
19:37 < manty> I'll rebuild them now
19:37 < joeyh> because the latest build appears to be as good as oct 8th
19:37 < joeyh> IMHO
19:38 < manty> anybody disagrees on this?
19:38 < joeyh> it works for me anyway ;-)
19:38  * pere have to run for a meeting.  :)
19:38 < manty> or do I replace the old ones with new ones?
19:38 -!- pere is now known as pere_poff
19:38 < manty> joeyh: I also agree, at least for my tests
19:38 < joeyh> you can hold off if you want, hopefully the new ones won't break much if anything
19:38 < joeyh> ok, good
19:39 < manty> joeyh: but should I replace them all or just i386?
19:39 < joeyh> oh, I can only speak for i386
19:39 < manty> I don't know a thing about other arches
19:39 < joeyh> I think powerpc is currently broken
19:39 < manty> well, then maybe it is good to let the old ones stay
19:39 < manty> till we find a really better one for all current builds
19:39 < manty> ok?
19:39 < joeyh> ok
19:40 < manty> only i386 needs rebuild, right?
19:40 < joeyh> yeah
19:40 < manty> ok
19:40 < manty> building
19:40 < Sahneschnitter> gaudenz: auround?
19:41 < manty> built!
19:41 < manty> anything else?
19:41 < joeyh> with luck we'll get a fixed bogl and pcmcia-udeb today anyway
19:42 < joeyh> should be all, thanks
19:42 < manty> you welcome
19:42 < joeyh> unless you want to test it of course
19:42 < manty> no time for it
19:42  * joeyh will in 5 hours or whenever the rsync completes
19:42 < manty> I still have to make the report for the bug in partitioning

15:04  * manty is building i386 full cd set (at last)
15:06 < manty> umm
15:06 < manty> stinks
15:06 < Marvin--> didn't work?
15:06 < manty> I've just seen that there are changes on debootstrap
15:08 < manty> Marvin--: nah, just that I had just installed 0.2.17 version of debootstrap
15:08 < manty> and there have been two updates since then
15:08 < Sesse> things happen rapidly in the debootstrap world ;-)
15:09 < manty> anyway, they'll be in for next week and for the daily build
15:09 < manty> I'll update it this afternoon so that I get in sync again
15:09 < manty> there were two important things in there
15:09 < manty>   * [sarge,sid] Display only the package name when retrieving packages.
15:09 < manty>     (Closes: #213669, #209273)
15:09 < manty>   * [sarge,sid] Added progress information for downloading package
15:09 < manty>     details. (Closes: #210912)
15:10 < Sesse> yup
15:10 < manty> :-(
15:10 < Sesse> #1 reduces the progress bar resizing
15:10 < manty> Sesse: next time please drop me a note
15:10 < Sesse> manty: ok. I wasn't aware of this. :-)
15:10 < manty> Sesse: at least if it is important like this one ;-)
15:11 < manty> Sesse: now that I think of it...
15:11 < Sesse> manty: to be honest, I don't really know what you're doing :-)
15:11 < manty> it is not important
15:11 < manty> Sesse: building the cds
15:11 < Sesse> it is cosmetical, not important
15:11 < manty> Sesse: but for the cds that doesn't matter
15:11 < Sesse> :-)
15:11 < Sesse> manty: well, it just flickers a whole lot less
15:11 < Sesse> #2 is not very important for the CDs, though
15:11 < manty> as I only use it for throwing in the packages in the cds
15:11 < Sesse> oh
15:11 < Sesse> in that case, it's _very_ unimportant :-)
15:12 < manty> it is important to have it in the cds
15:12 < manty> but not to use it for building the cds
15:12 < Sesse> manty: while we're at CDs, did you see the (small) thread on debian-boot about the businesscard/netinst image size some time ago?
15:12 < manty> which is what I use it for
15:12 < manty> I suppose so
15:12 < Sesse> there's quite a lot of stuff that should be stripped from the minimal image businesscard is supposed to be.
15:12 < Sesse> what's the easiest way to deal with that? :-)
15:12 < manty> yes
15:13 < manty> the first thing would be to have sarge doc and not woody's
15:13 < Sesse> :-)
15:13 < manty> I haven't looked at the problem in depth yet as we don't have all the sarge things
15:13 < manty> I have looked at some little problems
15:13 < Sesse> most of the sarge things probably aren't written yet
15:14 < manty> but I have not yet decided to comment them in the lists so that we decide what to do with them
15:14 < Sesse> mm

16:00 < Sesse>  pere: yes, I saw it
16:00 < Sesse> I'm rather puzzled over it, though
16:01 < Sesse> it strikes me that all the partitions have max=min, though
16:02 < Sesse> hmm, no
16:02 < Sesse> sorry, wrong
16:02 < Sesse> BTW, why is there an ' after $RAMSIZE?
16:02 < pere> Sesse: probably just cut-n-paste error.
16:03 < Sesse> ok
16:05 < Sesse> sounds like a bug in the distribution scheme somewhere

16:43 -!- decko is now known as decko|theater
16:43 < LBM> Wile_E: any massive changes since beta 1?
16:44 < Sesse> lots of bugfixes
16:44 < Sesse> (still more remaining, though)
16:44 < LBM> any _big_ ones worth mentioning?
16:45 < Sesse> probably not. we do not throw away everything between betas. ;-)

16:47 < LBM> okay, thanks
16:48 < LBM> and the last question from my, is it possible to install stable/woody (and not just testing/sarge) with debian-installer?
16:48 < LBM> me*
16:48 < Sesse> no
16:48 < wazer> i dont know if this issue has been resolved but I've found issues with usb keyboards on my tyan tiger mp system and some issues with usb keyboard on my nf2 setup
16:48 < wazer> well i think you can with the net boot installer
16:49 < Sesse> wazer: I think (_think_ :-) ) most of the problems with usb keyboards have been resolved. you probably want to check the latest images, though.
16:49 < wazer> thx
16:49 < wazer> just wanted to make sure
16:49 < LBM> Sesse: a friend of mine said it was possible, but no?
16:49 < Sesse> LBM: AFAIK it is not, and will not.

17:02 < Wile_E> LBM: no, daily builds work fine
17:02 < LBM> great, thanks
17:03 < Wile_E> Sesse: you can't install woody?!? i thought you could... at least you are given the choice when installling from network...
17:04 < Sesse> Wile_E: yes, you are, but I don't think it will work. I might be wrong, though.
17:05 < LBM> i hope, but i'll give you the answer later today or tomorrow (just need some functional ddr ram for this machine :/)

20:28 < Wile_E> Sesse: yeah, just reading it. a so far an extremely well researched articel which so for gives high praise :-)
20:29 < Sesse> well
20:29 < Sesse> most of the things he complains about are known bugs
20:29 < Sesse> (yes, we _do_ know about the dvorak problem. yes, we _do_ intend to have autopartkit and grub.)
20:29 < Sesse> but yes, it's very positive
20:31 < Wile_E> definitly
20:32 < Wile_E> about that keyboard thingy: i think i would prefer resetting the question to medium...
20:33 < Sesse> the question or the priority?
20:34 < Wile_E> the question
20:35 < pere> is the grub /boot/ problem fixed?
20:40 < Wile_E> pere: there has been an upload for grub yesterdsay (or the day before) but that was not in it. the maintainer did not even coment on it yet
20:40 < pere> hm
20:41 < pere> is it tagged d-i?
20:41 < pere> I found it.
20:42 < Sesse> ok. I can confirm that current d-i does not boot with serial console on alpha. :-)
20:44 < mrvn> Sesse: srm and "boot 3"?
20:44 < Wile_E> Sesse: and i can confirm that it does not install woody (at least the installed system does not boot for reasons i do not want to find out now)
20:46 < Wile_E> pere: you tagged it yourself ;-)
20:47 < pere> Wile_E: I noticed. :)

21:10 < waldi> why do you think static will work if the server don't see the bootp requests?
21:10 < Sesse> because some switch might be eating the broadcast etc.?
21:11 < Sesse> the cards work fine in linux
21:11 < Sesse> (and freebsd, and tru64, AFAIK :-) )
21:12 < p2-mate> Sesse: which card ?

22:13 < robertj> hey all, what is the baseline for being considered a low-memory install with d-i?
22:13 < robertj> I did an install yesterday on a 64 meg machine and it went swimmingly
22:15 < robertj> If i am not mistaken though stage 2 install didn't happen within stage1 even though I selected the module for that
22:22 -!- seppy_ is now known as seppy
22:33 < Wile_E> anyone here who can test my patch for update-grub to fix it for separate /boot partitions?
22:37 < mrvn> robertj: 64 MB seems to be the minimum. 32 doesn't work.
22:37 < mrvn> robertj: 48MB is probably untested
22:37 < Wile_E> mrvn: well i can give it a soht in vmware...
22:38 < mrvn> Wile_E: I think that can wait till shortly before the release wenn a number has to be but into the docs.
22:38 < mrvn> Doesn't realy matter if its 40, 48, 56MB now, it will stiff change a bit.
22:38 < mrvn> s/stiff/still/
22:39 < Wile_E> mrvn: since i am testing installs anyway, it won't hurt me
22:39 < mrvn> Esspecially if I get the kernel-image-debix packages to build on !i386.
22:40 < mrvn> Wile_E: You could check the various strange errors you get due to lack of ram. I guess a lot of udebs will break in strange ways if there is no space while they ran postinst.
22:40 < Wile_E> mrvn: probably... :-/
22:40 < mrvn> Maybe udpkg, main-menu or anna could check for free memory.
22:41 < mrvn> Memory stats at the bottom of the main menu screen would be nice.
22:42 < Wile_E> mrvn: pretty useless for most people...
22:42 < mrvn> Damn, another kernel build gone bad. another 5h wasted.
22:42 < mrvn> Wile_E: boot option DEBUG_MEM=1
22:43 < mrvn> or something. But it wouldn't hurt to show some hardware infos.
22:43 < Wile_E> on request, ok
22:44 < mrvn> I'm missing some HW-detect summary. List what hardware is detected, what ram, what drivers, ....
22:45 < Wile_E> yup, would be nice...
22:47 < robertj> mrvn: ive got a module that needs vendor specific parameters based off the pci device string, who do I talk to for that?
22:48 < mrvn> robertj: debian-boot?
22:48 < mrvn> joeyh did the module udebs so maybe you can get his attention
22:49 < robertj> mrvn: well I was thinking this was a discover problem
22:49 < robertj> truthfully, I didn't try it with d-i
22:49 < robertj> I just assumed since it doesnt work in discover as of last week or so it probably aint going to work in the udeb
22:49 < robertj> cogent thinking?
22:50 < mrvn> It should fail to install and decrease the debconf priority, the user select the next menu item and then gets asked for the parameters.
22:51 < mrvn> Can the parameter be derived from the pci output? Is that what you mean?
22:51 < robertj> mrvn: nahh you need a list
22:51 < robertj> for bttv modules specifically
22:51 < mrvn> not sure if thats supported in some way but might be possible with discover.
22:51 < robertj> "Ahh you have this card, so I need to probe with tuner=x
22:52 < robertj> its not going to do any good to ask because anyone who doesn't know to add to modules.conf aint going to know "well I've got a phillips tuner haven't I!"
22:52 < mrvn> robertj: But shouldn't that be part of the modules-init-tools config? We realy don't need bttv support in d-i
22:52 < robertj> mrvn: I know, but it should be part of discover
22:52 < robertj> and m-i-t uses discover right?
22:52 < mrvn> yeah, bug the discover maintainer.
22:53 < robertj> do you know...err...how discover works?
22:53 < mrvn> Not realy our problem since thats done after d-i is done and the main system boots the first time.
22:53 < robertj> I mean does it just probe everything at every boot?
22:53 < mrvn> When I installed base-config pulled in discover on the first boot, saved the config and purged it.
22:54 < robertj> where is the config saved for working systems
22:54 < mrvn> dunno
22:54 < Wile_E> btw: instal works with 48 MB
22:54 < robertj> anyway the install went fine on a p2 450 with 64 megs of ram and a funky ide controller from yesteryear
22:55 < robertj> I dont think it ran stage 2 inside of stage 1 like I asked
22:55 < robertj> maybe I didn't ask correctly
22:55 < robertj> also postings I have seen say there are gtk frontend examples around, is that really true or is that those 6 month old screenshots?
22:56 < mrvn> way out of sync afaik
22:57 < robertj> I do have a complaint about the verbosity
22:57 < Wile_E> robertj: gtk frontend is deferred
22:57 < robertj> Wile_E: I knew that, I just wanted to make sure noone had been an overachiever :P
22:58 < robertj> Wile_E: I really don't like being asked about mail exchange setup at the default level

22:58 < Wile_E> robertj: yeah, especially since _i_ have problem understanding it ;-)
22:58 < robertj> and I thought partitioning and fs choices were a bit overbearining
22:58 < Wile_E> what will the average user do with it?
22:58 < Wile_E> overbearining?
22:59 < robertj> hit enter and then be confounded by the fact the default choice just has the software ask you again
22:59 < robertj> err overbearing
22:59 < robertj> thats a double sin
22:59 < Wile_E> i don't understand
22:59 < robertj> having a message that has no default answer and is mostly unimportant in the scheme of things
22:59 < robertj> well its too indepth and too inquiring
22:59 < robertj> it needs to make some sane choices
23:00 < robertj> I dont think root fs should be a choice at the default installation verbosity
23:00 < Wile_E> robertj: you lost me. what are you talking about?
23:00 < Wile_E> ah.
23:00 < robertj> and the mail exchange message has no default answer, if you press enter it just prompts you again
23:01 < Wile_E> well, there are ideas to integrate autopartkit with partitioner. so the users can let do d-i the job of partitioning
23:01 < robertj> is that happening for sarge or not
23:01 < robertj> features should have been set in stone 6 months ago
23:01 < Wile_E> don't know.
23:01 < mrvn> autopartitioner partitions already
23:02 < mrvn> creates lots and lots of problems
23:02 < Wile_E> robertj: haha
23:02 < Wile_E> mrvn: yeah. i would not entrust my hds to autopartkit ;-)
23:02 < mrvn> Or do you mean the merging of the two methods in particular?
23:02 < Wile_E> mrvn: i mean to be able to choose between the two at defualt priority
23:03 < mrvn> Wile_E: If it would show me what it wants to do and lets me edit it....
23:03 < Wile_E> mrvn: yeah, _that_ would be great
23:03 < robertj> mvrn: and make that clear when you have the option to select it
23:03 < Wile_E> but that would mean to create more or less a debconf partitioner. ick
23:03 < robertj> "If you select me, I will ask you to confirm so I dont do something you will hate me for"
23:03 < robertj> Wile: nahh Anaconda does it fie
23:04 < mrvn> As I wrote on the ML: Have the partitioner look for free space and if it finds suggest partitions there. Then present a menu where one can edit the suggestions and finalize them.-
23:04 < robertj> basic choices: Install on all free space, nuke everything and install, manual partition
23:04 < mrvn> robertj: whats free space?
23:04 < robertj> non-partitioned space
23:04 < mrvn> I have lvm volumes that certainly aren't free. But what does the partitioner think?
23:05 < robertj> it thinks everything is full so you manually partition not a big deal
23:05 < mrvn> It has to show me exactly every partition change it does, every disk thats affected. And then I can say yes or no.
23:05 < robertj> autopart is really only for windows refugees who are wiping off one ide disk
23:05 < robertj> mrvn: you _always_ should manually partition
23:05 < robertj> always
23:05 < robertj> no matter whaat, always
23:05 < mrvn> robertj: windows refugees want to keep their windows just in case.
23:05 < robertj> we just need an easy way for newbs to nuke everything if they so choose
23:06 < robertj> oh
23:06 < robertj> one other common scenario for home users: nuking an entire harddrive while keeping the other
23:06 < robertj> gotta go all
23:06 < robertj> be back later
23:06 -!- robertj [~robertj@24.30.1.173] has quit ["leaving"]
23:06 < mrvn> I don't mind the partitioner poping up already showing that it will create a few new partitions in free space and then give me interactive control to modify to my likeing or accept.
23:07 < mrvn> But that would need a complete partitioner app, not just forking fdisk, afdisk, cfdisk, atafdisk, amiga-fdisk, mac-fdisk, ...
23:08 < mrvn> Anyone around tomorrow who would sponsor a kernel-image-debix package for me?
23:08 < mrvn> I'm off for tonight, messages will be saved.
23:24 < LBM> Sesse: a note for you, woody installed perfectly with debian-installer ;)
23:26 < Sesse> LBM: ok
23:30 < Wile_E> LBM: it did? i just tried it and the reboot failed...
23:37 < LBM> Wile_E: your right, i was too fast with my prediction - the installer seems to install the whole thing, but doesn't install lilo correctly
23:42 < LBM> well, fixed it with a rescue cd
23:46 < LBM> and it doesn't install the kernel/modules shipped with debian-installer - that's the reason i wanted to use it - because i need some sata ide support

00:02 < Wile_E> Sesse: ping
00:02 < Sesse> Wile_E: pong
00:02 < Wile_E> you have been looking into cdebconf's seen handling, not?
00:02 < Sesse> yes
00:03 < Sesse> not very deeply, though
00:03 < Wile_E> pewrhaps you know what is going on here:
00:04 < Wile_E> if i abort partconf (hit abort in its main-menu), i can't select it again from the main menu.
00:04 < Sesse> yes, we seemed to discuss this on d-b a few days ago
00:04 < Sesse> the problem is, I assumed main-menu would use dpkg-reconfigure
00:04 < Sesse> which it doesn't
00:04 < Wile_E> ah.
00:04 < Sesse> somebody has to change main-menu to set showold on reconfiguring
00:04 < Sesse> (but only on reconfiguring :-) )
00:05 < Wile_E> but that is the problem: partconf won't even be reconfigured at that time. hitting abort will leave it unconfigured
00:05 < Wile_E> which makes sense!
00:06 < Sesse> well
00:06 < Sesse> its question will still be marked seen, no? :-)
00:06 < Wile_E> yes, and i presume it will then be skipped?
00:06 < Wile_E> but skipping the question which was answered with "abort" is not very useful ;-)
00:07 < Sesse> they should not really be skipped. "abort" should really reset the seen flags
00:08 < Wile_E> Sesse: ok. i supposed that would be the solution

14:52 < Wile_E> hi Marvin--
14:52  * Marvin-- ponders
14:52 < Marvin--> so...
14:52 < Marvin--> as everybody knows, I haven't done any work on d-i for ages because I've been way too busy
14:53 < Wile_E> Marvin--: we noted ;-)
14:53 < Marvin--> so I've probably missed something, but why do I have to config network for the 'netinst' CD? It already has base on it
14:53 < Marvin--> it is needed for businesscard, but not for netinst
14:53 < Wile_E> ppl, complain often about in in the install-report... but:
14:54 < mrvn> So base-config can fetch debs from the net?
14:54 < Marvin--> you may or may not need it for base-config
14:54 < Marvin--> and base-config has no network config possibilities?
14:54 < Wile_E> you will need networking sooner or later, since everyone will want to have additional package besides base
14:54 < Wile_E> and why shouldn't we configure it in d-i then?
14:54 < mrvn> It doesn't but it should
14:54 < Marvin--> then why do we bother with having two different CDs at all?
14:55 < Marvin--> sounds totally useless
14:55 < mrvn> Marvin--: dsl, isdna nd modem needs it.
14:55 < Wile_E> i agree, that configuring the network should be easily skippable
14:55 < Marvin--> (and the question asking me which kernel module I need for my nic is horrible :)
14:56 < Marvin--> would it be possible to at least show card names in the list?
14:56 < Marvin--> I don't know where that list comes from, so...
14:57 < Marvin--> mrvn: needs what?
14:59 < mrvn> Marvin--: dsl, isdna nd modem need base packages
14:59 < Marvin--> does netcfg even support isdn and modems?
14:59 < mrvn> no
14:59 < mrvn> you need pppd
15:00 < Marvin--> holy crap, choose-mirror is before netcfg-static in the menu
15:01 < Wile_E> when does cdebconf set the seen flag for a question?
15:06 -!- delYsid [mlang@delysid.usercloak.freenode] has joined #debian-boot
15:08 < Marvin--> hm, okay, so basically, until I configure the nic (non-existant I think, since this is bochs), for every menu item I pick, it will perform it, re-raise to high and try to configure the nic, fail and drop to medium?
15:10 < Wile_E> Marvin--: yes, that is the most reported bug in installation reports. there must be a way to skip questions forever
15:10 < Marvin--> okay
15:10 < Marvin--> right
15:11 < Wile_E> Marvin--: however that is not too easy. one thing i thought about: always when a menu item suceeds mark all items below it as configured too
15:11 < Wile_E> don't know what will happen though ;-)
15:11 < Marvin--> I know, it's horribly complicated
15:12 < Marvin--> but I think the problem is rather with the auto-raising
15:12 < Marvin--> it failed on ethdetect, it shouldn't pop back up to high just because it succeeds with something else that's completely unrelated
15:12 < Wile_E> yeah, that would be yet another possibility. start raising behind medium only after the last default item has changed
15:13 < Wile_E> but that would suck, too: the defualt would always stay at the offending item
15:13 < Marvin--> it should definitely not auto-raise it after doing something in the neverdefault range
15:13 < Marvin--> indeed
15:14 < Marvin--> but at least that's better than always retrying it, failing and THEN going to the menu having it default ;)
15:14 < Sesse> hehe
15:14 < mrvn> Whats effect does the debconf priority have on etherdetect anyway?
15:14 < Wile_E> Marvin--: there is yet another problem: consider this: prio is high, something fails -> prio gets lowered to medium. now you want to continue with prio medium, go to the debconf prio menu entry and...:
15:15 < Wile_E> it is set to medium. main-.menu can't detect the users wish to keep the prio at medium...
15:15 < Wile_E> workaround: set the prio to low and then to medium ;-)
15:15 < Wile_E> then it will stay at medium and won't be raised again
15:15 < Marvin--> oh dear :)
15:16 < Sesse> ick
15:16 < Wile_E> indeed.
15:16 < Marvin--> yeah, figuring out when it should stay in menu mode and when it should hop back to auto mode is tricky
15:16 < Sesse> Wile_E: that sounds overly complicated. I'm quite sure main-menu distinguishes between its own and external priority changes?
15:17 < Wile_E> Sesse: yeah, it tries to. i detect external changes by this: compare debconf/priority with my internal setting if that has changed during a question, someone must have altered it externally
15:17 < Sesse> mm
15:17 < Wile_E> but if the prio is (temporatrily due to a error) set to medium, there is nothing to change externally in cdebconf-priority-udeb
15:18 < Wile_E> Sesse: this "seen" thingy is btw. nastier than expected :-(
15:18 < Sesse> why?
15:19 < Wile_E> cdebconf seems to set the seen flag after the script has terminated, so i have no possibility to unset it during the script
15:19 < Sesse> well
15:19 < Sesse> it caches the seen settings
15:19 < Sesse> it should include the not-seen settings in that cache.
15:20 < Wile_E> the behaavier should be like this(tm): if a user backs out into the main-menu, no question may have the seen flag, correct?
15:21 < Wile_E> because: if run again, it won't be called with reconfigure and so the "seen" questions will be skipped. which is bad, because i backed out and surely want to get asked the questions again the second time
15:22 < Sesse> how does cdebconf know that the program backed out?
15:23 -!- azeem [~mbanck@proxy-out.lrz-muenchen.de] has joined #debian-boot
15:23 < Wile_E> it doesn't ;-) and main-menu can't handle that either because it knows nothing of the asked questions ;-)
15:23 < Sesse> perhaps we should have a cdebconf flag for each package: "has this ever been attempted configured  before"
15:23 < Sesse> which is set just before the first time main-menu attempts to configure the package
15:23 < Sesse> and, for all subsequent runs, will cause debconf/showold=true
15:24 < Wile_E> Sesse: hmhm, cdebconf know nothing of packages...?
15:24 < Sesse> Wile_E: main-menu does.
15:25 < Sesse> main-menu/seen-netcfg-static = true
15:25 < Sesse> or whatever
15:25 < Sesse> main-menu/netcfg-static/seen, perhaps
15:25 < Sesse> or something
15:26 < Wile_E> Sesse: hmhm... i don't like that... i need to know: when does cdebconf apply the seen flags?
15:26 < Sesse> Wile_E: whenever DEBCONF_SHOWOLD=false (or not set) or debconf/showold=false
15:26 < Sesse> ie. by default
15:26 < Sesse> (AFAIK)
15:27 < Wile_E> Sesse: if it did it at the end of the running script, there could be a cdebconf command to forget all the seen flags it has accumulated. this command would be issued by the controlling script when the user backed out to main-menu
15:27 < Sesse> Wile_E: you mean the postinst script?
15:28 < Wile_E> Sesse: yep
15:28 < Sesse> yes, that would be a valid solution.
15:28 < Sesse> would require extending the debconf protocol, though.
15:28 < Sesse> I'm not sure if that is too wise in the long run
15:28 < Wile_E> Sesse: i heard somewhere that cdebconf sets this seen flags only after the script terminates, which would make sense!
15:28 < Sesse> Wile_E: that is correct
15:28 < Sesse> Wile_E: debconf also does that
15:29 < Sesse> simply to support backing up properly
15:29 < Wile_E> Sesse: ah, yes, of course.
15:32 < Wile_E> hm, i think it is a cdebconf issue. there must be a possibility to tell cdebconf to leave the questions unseen. this requirement comes with backing up!
15:33 < Sesse> look at confmodule.c
15:33 < Sesse> the confmodule_update_seen_questions() function
15:34 < Sesse> looks like more of a stack than a cache
15:34 < Sesse> weird implementation :-)
15:35 < Wile_E> indeed. i'd say add a STACK_PURGE to that function, which deletes the stack. then add a new funtion to cdebconf whch calls that...
15:35 < Wile_E> but let's see whre STACK_REMOVE is called...
15:36 < Sesse> commands.c
15:36 < Sesse> around line 210
15:37 < Wile_E>         asprintf(&out, "%u backup", CMDSTATUS_GOBACK);
15:37 < Wile_E>         mod->update_seen_questions(mod, STACK_SEEN_REMOVE);
15:37 < Sesse> cdebconf obviously assumes goback will take the user exactly one step backwards
15:37 < Sesse> otherwise, the entire thing blows
15:37 < Sesse> ok, that is probably a valid assumption
15:37 < Wile_E> whee...
15:39 < Sesse> oh, confmodule has some checks against that
15:40 < Sesse> anyhow
15:40 < Sesse> check save(), close to the top of debconf.c
15:40 < Sesse> one could do some kind of check there
15:40 < Sesse> if SIGUSR1 gets called in the middle of the postinst script, it will get saved anyhow, but heck, such is life :-)
15:41 < Wile_E> hehe
15:43 < Wile_E> bah
15:43 < Wile_E> i suppose that needs more thinking...
15:44 < Wile_E> seems like i have to reassign to cdebconf and raise it on boot...
15:55 < Wile_E> so, nothing accomplished, next issue: what do you think of switching protocol and country question in choose-mirror. in that case we could ask the protocol question with prio=high if the user chose "Enter mirror manually". That won't restrict him to http servers

17:54 < waldi> yes
17:55 < agx> I'm looking for help about customizing debian-installer
17:56 < Sesse> please ask your question. :-)
17:56 < agx> Basically i upgraded my sistem from the stable release to the unstable, downloaded via CVS the debian-installer tree and compiled everything fine with "make TYPE=hd-image", it worked, now i would like to customize.
17:57 < Sesse> again, please ask your question
17:57 < agx> I think that is simplier to start from the language selection, i would like to change the .udeb for the language in order to select directly the italian language without asking anything to the user. This is my question :-)
17:57 < Sesse> there are multiple ways to do that
17:58 < Sesse> the cleanest is probably simply using debconf preseeding
17:58 < agx> I suppose to create my udeb in favour of the default one.
17:58 < Sesse> no, that is not needed
17:58 < Sesse> you can simply make a debconf database containing the answers you want
17:58 < Sesse> and that they are already seen
17:58 < Sesse> then they will be skipped by cdebconf.
17:58 < agx> without user input?
17:58 < Sesse> yes
17:59 < agx> wonderfull
17:59 < agx> where is explained that? man debconf??
17:59 < Sesse> well, slightly unsure
17:59 < Sesse> but when you install, there is a file /var/cache/cdebconf/questions.dat
17:59 < Sesse> (if I remember right)
17:59 < Sesse> cut-and-paste what you need out of that
17:59 < Sesse> and make sure the questions.dat is included on your installation media (with EXTRAFILES=)
17:59 < Sesse> and it should work
18:00 < Sesse> (there is probably some cleaner way to do this as well :-) )
18:00 < agx> Yes, this solve my problem but do not teach myself how to customize debian-installer :-)
18:01 < agx> What about creating my udeb to be inserted into the menu?
18:02 < Sesse> read doc/modules.txt
18:02 < Wile_E> agx: and have a look at existing udebs
18:03 < delYsid> joeyh: you there?
18:03 < agx> thanks, i'll already read it, i make a package that replage the language.udeb
18:03 < agx> what i don not understand is how to test again the installation with this new package (make demo)

18:05 < Sesse> why do you want to replace the languagechooser udeb
18:05 < Sesse> ?
18:05 < Sesse> it doesn't make any sense.
18:05 < agx> it's just an example, i wanna an udeb of mine to do the work
18:05 < Sesse> put it in localudebs/
18:06 < agx> in build/config i created a clone of hd-image called "badpenguin", so in build/pkg-types/badpenguin i replaced languagechoose with the name of my udeb

18:06 < agx> yes, i put it in localudebs/ but if i make TYPE=badpenguin it does not recognize this
18:07 < Sesse> clean first
18:07 < agx> every thime?
18:08 < agx> sorry: every time?
18:08 < Sesse> dunno
18:08 < Sesse> I always do it =)
18:08 < agx> yes this surely work but how to develop? if i'm testing with (make demo) and i change a single script have i to always redo the package, and building everything from scratch? seems non sense :-)
18:09 < Sesse> that's why you do not change the udebs unless you have to ;-)
18:11 < agx> ok, so i think that i have to try to mount R/W in loopback the image and work directly on it :-) ????
18:16 < agx> last question: where to find a good debconf howto?
18:16 < Sesse> try /usr/share/doc/debconf
18:24 < agx> funny :-) i always look there or for the man page.... those dir just contains README.Debian changelog.gz and copyright .... no docs :-(
18:24 < mrvn> agx: use make-demo then you have no image.
18:25 < mrvn> agx: I'm thinking baout makeing the images depend on their respective pkg-lists and udebs but so far a good way to do this has eluded me.
18:25 < agx> mrvn: so i modify directly the file under build/tmp/demo ?
18:26 < mrvn> agx: for trying things out that will do.
18:26 < agx> mrvn: thanks, this was not clean to me after reading docs/, now it is :-)
18:26 < agx> just need a URL to a debconf manual/tutorial/howto/whatever and i'm fine for today
18:27 < mrvn> agx: Its hacking but thats what you want to do. The clean way is to build correct udebs and rebuild the images but it takes too long.
18:28 < agx> mrvn: it's ok this... now i've to learn debconf but was unable to find docs about it

19:30 < vorlon> Erm?
19:31 < mrvn> kernel-image-2.4.22-generic -> kernel-image-2.4.22-alpha-generic

19:32 < mrvn> vorlon: kernel-image-<hostname> is somewhat much nicer.
19:32  * vorlon wonders if there's any need for a different kernel-headers package for xfs-patched kernels.
19:32 < vorlon> ... <hostname> ?
19:33 < mrvn> vorlon: any kernel-image needs a specific kernel-headers package. Otherwise the modversions don't match.
19:33 < mrvn> vorlon: one for each host I have.
19:34 < vorlon> Oh, modversions, blech.
19:34 < mrvn> vorlon: do you know why they are actually needed?
19:34 < mrvn> I only had problems with them, never helped me.
19:34 < vorlon> I guess that means I can't use the mainline kernel pcmcia packages, either. :)
19:35 < vorlon> What, modversions?  They're supposed to guarantee that you don't try to load a module that needs a certain function into a kernel that provides the same function, but with different behavior.
19:36 < mrvn> vorlon: But thats normaly covered by the kernel version, i.e. 2.4.22

19:39 < robertj> correct me when I am wrong, but I don't remember being prompted to verbosity when I installed sarge the other day
19:39 < robertj> did I just press enter automatically without thinking or is it on a menu?
19:40 < Md> I suggest that /lost+found is removed from the initrd images, it's useless and will only waste space
19:40 < mrvn> Md: its only 30 bytes or so.
19:40 < mrvn> compressed
19:41 < mrvn> Is there an mkfs option to preventlost+found?
19:41 < Md> mrvn: no, but you can just rmdir it
19:41 < robertj> why is lost+found needed?
19:41 < mellum> for 30 fucking bytes?
19:41 < Md> it's small, but not as small as 30 bytes, as it contains the preallocated space
19:42 < Md> robertj: it's used by fsck to orphaned inodes
19:42 < mrvn> Md: 1K blocks all zeroed out.
19:42 < robertj> I just dont like having extra directories laying around
19:42 < robertj> Md: could we err, move it then?
19:42 < robertj> its not in the FHS AFAIK
19:42 < mrvn> robertj: on the initrd you can delete it.
19:42 < Md> robertj: I'm not sure
19:42 < robertj> and is it all fsck or just ext2 stuff
19:42 < mrvn> robertj: lost+found better be in / of each fs.
19:43 < robertj> mrvn: why's that?
19:43 < mrvn> robertj: the problem is that when a dir/file is found by fsck it has to be put somewhere. That could require allocating additional inode blocks (which is very bad on a broken FS). lost+found has a few blocks preallocated for just thi case.
19:44 < mrvn> If lost+found is in /var/lost+found its hidden wehn /var is mounted. Same for every other dir.

19:45 < vorlon> Not into that sort of thing.
19:45 < Lo-lan-2> I just wonder what files to put on floppy...
19:45 < Md> anyway... I'm here because I'm trying to understand how much complex it will be supporting ADSL netinstalls...
19:45 < Lo-lan-2> bootfloppy-image.img? floppy-image.img? net_drivers-image.img?
19:45 < mrvn> -rw-r--r--    1 root     root         1.5M Nov 16 17:56 bootfloppy-image.img
19:46 < mrvn> -rw-r--r--    1 root     root         1.5M Nov 16 17:56 floppy-image.img
19:46 < p2-mate> Md: very complex I'm afraid
19:46 < mrvn> Lo-lan-2: rest is optional.
19:46 < robertj> AFAIK thats in the same low-low-evenlowerthangui priority as WiFi installs
19:46 < mrvn> Md: get vendors so relicence the binary drivers dfsg free.
19:47 < Md> mrvn: of the common drivers, only one has a binary part, the others are all free
19:47 < mrvn> Md: You need to resurrect ppp.udeb, write a pppoe/a udeb (cp will do for starters), write a pppoe/a-config.udeb.
19:48 < p2-mate> configure bridging
19:48 < Md> mrvn: the problem is firmwares, and vendors will never ever release the source for these (and even if they were willing, many of them are based on some commercial RT OS)
19:48 < robertj> btw, I've got a SpeedTouch external I'll let go of :)
19:48  * azeem wonders whether work on that would be accepted into 3.1r1
19:49 < p2-mate> take care of those weird places which use neither pppoe nor pppoa
19:49 < azeem> ...if it's to late for 3.1
19:49 < mrvn> Md: What exactly do you mean with netinstall? the 5, 20, 50 or 190 MB cdrom?
19:49 < Md> mrvn: right now I'm trying to understand where the package will have to go
19:49 < mrvn> Md: Start with making debs for the installed system.
19:49 < Md> mrvn: the initrd is unacceptable, because all the programs needed will not fit
19:50 < Md> mrvn: this is being done (see speedtouch and eciadsl)
19:50 < robertj> at the very least if they are free you might could get them shoved on the cds early on so you just need one smallish disk
19:50 < mrvn> Would they fit on 1.4 MB on its own?
19:50 < Md> mrvn: yes
19:50 < robertj> probably this is one of those setups thats just low on the priority list for now
19:51 < p2-mate> what about installing over LANE  ? :)
19:51 < robertj> anyone shipping lots of machines can preload the stuff and anyone from scratch needs to just download a full set if they cant figure it out on their own
19:51 < mrvn> Md: All on one or 1 driver floppy per modem and 1 pppd/pppoe/config floppy?
19:51 < Md> p2-mate: it needs less software than some ADSL types :-)
19:51 < p2-mate> Md: really ? :) LANE is complex :)
19:51 < Md> mrvn: maybe without the firmwares one floppy is all is needed
19:52 < Sesse> ugh. somebody ought to NMU reiserfsprogs soon.
19:52 < mrvn> Md: How do you know what firmware to load? Can you probe the modem?
19:52 < Md> p2-mate: sure, but it just needs a few kernel modules (most of them needed for ADSL too) and the linux-atm package (needed for ADSL too)
19:52 < p2-mate> mrvn: usb devices have manuf/device ids
19:52 < Md> mrvn: my packages support USB hotplug
19:53 < Md> if it's an ethernet modem then only pppd and a couple of kernel modules are needed, but the user will have to know that there is a modem there
19:53 < mrvn> Md: Ok. First thing then would be to add support for dsl to base-config.
19:53 < Md> well, it could be probed too, but it's a bit painful
19:53 < p2-mate> Md: can't you probe for that as well ?
19:53 < mrvn> Md: Get your debs into base (or included by debootstrap)
19:53 < p2-mate> Md: using this UPNP magic perhaps ?
19:53 < Md> p2-mate: yes, you can send a PADI packet and check it the remote NAS will reply
19:53 < p2-mate> Md: oh. that's another way yes
19:53 < Md> p2-mate: no, I understand that most modems do not support UPNP
19:54 < p2-mate> mine does, but I have no idea what UPNP actually does :)
19:54 < Md> mrvn: note well: I really do not care if the user will have to hand edit the pppd configuration, I'm not interested in writing a configuration frontend. all I care is that our users will be able to netinstall by downloading the smallest possible image
19:55 < Md> p2-mate: it's a very cool technology, but not really useful for a modem, especially if you will run PPP on the host
19:55 < Md> somebody talked about a 5 MB image, where is it?
19:55 < mrvn> Md: I don#t think udebs that need handediting would be accepted.
19:56 < waldi> hmm, isn't upnp the automatic backdoor accessibility protocol?
19:56 < Md> waldi: yes
19:56 < mrvn> MD: Its a cdrom with the netboot kernel and initrd as el torrito bootimage.
19:56 < Md> mrvn: net_drivers-image.img?
19:57 < mrvn> Md: Does the pppoa modems work with pppoeconfig?

19:57 < Sesse> what creates /target? partconf?
19:57 < Md> ok, I was looking at it
19:57 < mrvn> Md: not even after changing pppoe to pppoa?
19:58 < Md> mrvn: no, it's way different and pppoa needs more configuration
19:58 < Sesse> or, more precisely, what creates /target/var/log? :-)
19:58 < Lo-lan-2> SYSLINUX 2.04 2003-04-16 Boot failed
19:58 < Lo-lan-2> Damn.
19:58 < Md> can the netboot initrd grow a few hundred KB or is it full?
19:58 < mrvn> Md: Then that would be the first think to do. Make debs that can be used to install and configure. Those can then be included on the netinstall cd and called from d-i
19:59 < waldi> Md: ask joey hes, he just added 40kb
19:59 < Md> joeyh: ?
19:59 < Md> probably, pppoe would fit
19:59 < mrvn> Md: For syslinux the limit is 2.88 MB. For netboot its usually 4MB. isolinux basically has no limit.
20:00 < Md> ok, let's assume the limit is syslinux. it will not fit...
20:00 < Lo-lan-2> Any clue?  Or are the floppies known broken?
20:00 < waldi> Md: how large is pppoe?
20:00 < robertj> can someone double check my post to d-b entitled prune verbosity
20:00 < waldi> Md: you should always collect gzip compressed sized
20:01 < mrvn> Md: Assume you have some boot medium to load additional (u)debs from, like pppd, pppoe, pppoe-config, pppoa,...
20:01 < Md> what does the business card .iso contain? only udebs to be installed in the ramdisk or real .deb packages too?
20:01 < Md> mrvn: yes, this is the next topic
20:02 < mrvn> Md: businesscard is just d-i
20:02 < mrvn> (udebs)
20:02 < Md> where can I see what's there without downloading the images?
20:02 < mrvn> Md: debian-cd source?
20:03 < mrvn> Md: all udebs should be on it bsically, see debian-installer/Packages
20:03  * vorlon ponders.  Is it really worth building XFS-enabled kernel images for a 386 flavor?
20:03 < mrvn> vorlon: only if you include device mapper
20:03 < vorlon> erm?
20:04 < Md> waldi: pppd + the pppoe plugin + all ppp and pppoe kernel modules is about 130 KB (compressed)
20:04 < mrvn> Md: You probably have to change netcfg-* to allow for dsl too.
20:05 < waldi> etcfg-ppp does anything?
20:05 -!- Lo-lan-2 [~roland@81.56.186.204] has left #Debian-boot ["Leaving"]
20:05 < mrvn> waldi: is that still in archive? I though ppp udeb was removed for now.
20:06 < waldi> don't know
20:06 < vorlon> mrvn: if you want device mapper support, you'll have to submit a patch. :P
20:06 < robertj> vorlon: *sigh*,one of these days we need to get the autobuildre for kernels and kernel modules on the ball
20:06 < mrvn> vorlon: kernel-patch-device-mapper
20:06 < Md> ok, next topic: how hard is to load new .udebs from a FAT hard disk fs or USB pen drive when using the netinstall initrd?
20:06 < vorlon> mrvn: a *package* patch, not a *kernel* patch.
20:06 < vorlon> :P
20:06 < Md> (I'm not really interested in supporting floppy-based installs)
20:06 < mrvn> robertj: whats the problem?
20:07 < mrvn> robertj: allow source-only uploads and its done.
20:07 < Md> waldi: I think it was removed because it was useless, so I removed ppp.udeb too. there was a short thread on the mailing list
20:07 < Md> extra .udebs are needed anyway to load the firmwares
20:07 < robertj> mrvn: the fact that kernel modules arent build against kernels is a problem IMO
20:07 < robertj> but I am in favor of source only uploads
20:08 < robertj> keeps everyone honest and all that
20:08 < mrvn> robertj: you mean the depmod file won't be right or what?
20:09 < robertj> no I mean that there are things floating around in unstable that arent available against certain precompiled kernels
20:09 < mrvn> robertj: ahh, the extra module packages.
20:10 < mrvn> That would need some more magic than autobuilders are supposed to have.
20:10 < robertj> how much more magic?
20:10 < mrvn> robertj: write bug report against the module debs that they should build against more kernel images.
20:11 < robertj> granted some patches are not going to apply in which case things have to b0rk noisily
20:11 < robertj> but where do you draw the linke
20:11 < mrvn> You need to get a list of all kernel-images ever to be released in the past and future for which the module applies, build-depends on eahc of them and build.
20:12 < robertj> should the build against every kernel image the supported device (if it exists) physically can fit ino r what
20:12 < mrvn> And somehow you have to ignore the build failures for not yet existing images and rebuild them later.
20:12 < robertj> well couldn't you figure that if it it appleis against a given sub arch once it should apply from then on unless otherwise specified
20:13 < mrvn> robertj: it should just come as source and compile on install.
20:13 < mrvn> Anyone who is not using the default kernel image should have enough time to compile the odd module now and then.
20:14 < robertj> mrvn: some of them are packaged funkily though
20:14 < robertj> like lirc is a total pain
20:14 < mrvn> robertj: Do you know if the extra modules supply a kernel-patch deb too?
20:14 < robertj> mrvn: it depends lirc  is a module for 2.4 and a kernel patch for 2.6
20:15 < robertj> :)
20:15 < mrvn> robertj: Read my mail concerning debian kernel package on debian-devel.
20:15 < mrvn> robertj: a custom made kernel-compile package depending on the patch set you need would solve the problem nicely.
20:17 < robertj> I really think this is more an issue of lirc being ugly and the packaging being ugly as well
20:17 < robertj> I really think most users should not have to compile their kernel
20:18 < robertj> if your going to go that route then I would almost really prefer that Debian just not touch the kernel at all
20:18 < Md> either ppp.udeb is resurrected or ppp-modules.udeb should be killed
20:19 < mrvn> robertj: you have the sandard images for normal use and custom compiles for more control.
20:19 < mrvn> robertj: Aso the same mechanism for compiling kernel could be used just for extra modules.
20:20 < robertj> mrvn: you shouldnt need more control to use extra hardware
20:24 < robertj> right?
20:26 < Md> summary: a pppoe-netinstall initrd /could/ be made, but I'm not sure it's worth the effort. the USB modems require plenty (~1 MB?) of .udebs (some of them which cannot be provided by us), and they could go on the business card CD
20:27 < mrvn> robertj: nop, just if you want to optimize for it.
20:27 < mrvn> Md: people with dsl can easily download a 50-100MB cd with base. I would work towards that.
20:27 < robertj> well you currently cant do that
20:28 < robertj> if you want lirc you have to install from src, and depnding on what kernel revision, maybe lufs, alsa, etc.
20:28 < mrvn> robertj: sure you can.
20:28 < Md> I could make .udebs of pppd and everything else needed, as long as there is a consensus that somebody else will work on the frontend or they can go on the CD even if they will have to be configured manually
20:28 < mrvn> robertj: thats lirc brokenness and out-of-dateness.
20:28 < robertj> so is that grounds for removal?
20:28 < mrvn> robertj: When lirc was packaged that way there weren't even kernel-images around in todays form.
20:28 < Md> mrvn: if they can download enough to install the base system then they could as well pick the few regular .debs from a mirror and install them with dpkg
20:29 < Md> mrvn: I'm considering a "smallest possible initial download" scenario
20:29 < mrvn> Md: base would be on the cd.
20:29 < mrvn> Md: my base cd is 51MB for i386.
20:30 < mrvn> Md: Thats a 10 minute download with the slower dsl types.
20:30 < Md> mrvn: do you mean that base (i.e. everything needed to install and boot the system) is installed from udebs? because that CD does not contains .debs
20:31 < mrvn> Md: no, the 51 MB contain 12 MB udebs and all debs for base.
20:32  * Md wonders WTF they are hidden:
20:32 < Md> root@attila:/tmp/b/pool/main# find | egrep '\\.deb$'
20:32 < Md> [Exit 1]
20:32 < mrvn> Md: I don't think you have an image build from my tree.
20:32 < mrvn> The official images are still all debian-cd build.
20:33 < Md> mrvn: this is http://gluck.debian.org/cdimage/testing/netinst/i386/daily/sarge-i386-netinst.iso
20:33 < Md> err no, sarge-i386-businesscard.iso
20:33 < Md> 52.6 MB, built yesterday
20:33 < mrvn> Md: my businesscard isonly 20MB :)
20:33 < Md> and where did you get it from then?
20:33 < mrvn> debian-cd has a lot of bloat on the official CDs
20:34 < mrvn> Md: They are build by the "mrvn" branch.
20:35 < Md> anyway, if you say that a 20 MB download is enough to download something which can be rebooted and used to install real .deb packages then it's all I want
20:35 < Md> can you confirm this?
20:36 < mrvn> No, 50 MB is enough.
20:36 < Md> ok, a 50 MB download which allows to install real .debs is still OK for me
20:36 < mrvn> Better say 55MB or so when docs are added.
20:37 < mrvn> Md: Anything that can be downloaded within 15 minues I feel is acceptable.
20:37 < Md> mrvn: I think that the limit is 64 MB, the size of the cheapest USB pen drive
20:37 < mrvn> Md: Or that.
20:37 < Sesse> the limit for a businesscard ISO is slightly below that.
20:37 < Sesse> I'd believe
20:37 < mrvn> I should get one of those.
20:37 < Sesse> I think it's actually 40MB or something
20:38 < Md> Sesse: the one on gluck is 52 MB
20:38 < mrvn> Sesse: 33MB or something for the square ones iirc.
20:38 < Sesse> Md: yes, but it is too big :-)
20:38 < Md> mrvn: I'm not sure: the lnx-bbc image is 50 MB
20:38 < mrvn> Md: that just intended to become bussinessvcard size.
20:38 < mrvn> Md: Sure its for the square kind and not the round kind?
20:39 < Md> mrvn: I don't know
20:39 < mrvn> I only found round cd-r media so far.
20:39 < mrvn> Some cd-rw round and square media would be nice for testing.
20:39 < Md> anyway, let's say that users with an USB modem will have to download the business card-sized image and then manually install a few .debs (I will provide documentation and maybe a script)
20:40 < Md> do we want to make something better for PPPoE users? it should not be hard
20:40 < mrvn> Md: a "probe-dsl" program that will look what firmware is needed and apt-get install it?
20:41 < Md> mrvn: I assume that users will now which driver package they need
20:41 < mrvn> base-config could ask if the user wants to install dsl and then fetch the required extra debs from cd and run the config prog.
20:42 < mrvn> base-config already fetched read-edid, discover and libdiscover from the cd anyway.
20:43 < Md> do not forget that manual install of the firmware files will still be needed, hotplug must be working, and everything has to be configured manually. I don't think that just this bit of automation will be worth the effort, for now
20:44 < mrvn> Md: as I said, write a dsl-config and package the free firmwares.
20:44 < Md> let's get back to pppoe: do we want to try fitting in in the standard netinst initrd? In a pppoe initrd? In the business card image?
20:44 < mrvn> Md: And check that the README you want to write for dsl gets included on the cd.
20:45 < mrvn> Md: don#t think its worth it, the cd with base is small enough.
20:45 < Md> mrvn: as I said, I'm not interested at all in writing a dsl-config package (which would be very cool, but also a huge effort to do it right) and all the most popular modems need firmwares cannot be redistributed
20:46 < mrvn> A dsl initrd would need a firmware floppy wich sucks.
20:46 < Md> mrvn: I'm still talking about pppoe, no firmware needed. just pppd and a few kernel modules
20:46 < mrvn> Ok, still not worth it. It doesn't save any download compared to a base cd.
20:47 < Md> about 130 KB, I think
20:47 < mrvn> +pppoeconf
20:47 < Md> I'm not responsible for pppoeconf, its maintainer will have to make it usable for the boot disks
20:48 < mrvn> Md: then hit him untill he does or there will be no dsl initrd.
20:48 < Md> it's a convoluted 10 KB shell script which uses dialog and user space pppoe, which I do not plan to support
20:49 < Md> it would have to be rewritten from scratch
20:49 < mrvn> or do that.
20:49 < mrvn> Without providing a config any DSL support in d-i is pointless.
20:49 < mrvn> Remeber you hav no docs and no good editor in d-i
20:49 < Md> it's not... most users know how to put their own username and password in /etc/ppp/pap-secrets
20:50 < mrvn> I realy would leave that for after base in installed.
20:50 < Md> but yes, if the target is the CD image then there is no big difference in installing it before or after the system has been rebooted
20:51 < mrvn> You would need to abort the d-i installation at some point to configure pppoe manually and that just makes problems.
20:51 < Md> yes. looks like there is a consensus of two for no PPP support for d-i. :-)
20:51 < Md> if it's OK for you I will send this log to the mailing list
20:51 < vorlon> are there any reasons why the smp kernel-images are currently unsuitable for UP machines?
20:51 < mrvn> Md: I don't think you get anyone to agree on icnluding it without a config forntend.
20:51 < vorlon> (686, specifically)
20:57 -!- Md [md@md.staff.freenode] has left #debian-boot []
20:58 < mrvn> You've been warned, get-packages has been commited.
20:58 < mrvn> Ok, what to break next?
20:59 < Arrogance> how about an auto-partitioner.  :)
21:00 < mrvn> parconf and auto-partitioner need to be merged in a complete rewrite.
21:00 < Arrogance> I'd be happy if debootstrap didn't go catatonic on awk
21:00 < mrvn> awk?
21:01 < Arrogance> ya.  Makes a horrible mess.  I can't get the known good image to install sid
21:01 < mrvn> I was more talking abpout merging stuff rom my branch into main.
21:01 < Arrogance> oh
21:01 < Arrogance> where is your branch?
21:01 < mrvn> -r mrvn
21:01 < mrvn> Since something like 3 month
21:02 < mrvn> or 2
21:02 < Arrogance> what makes it unique?  (In a few sentences)
21:02 < Arrogance> I've sufficiently broken my new server, so I'm looking for new playgrounds.  :)
21:02 < mrvn> different build script and it will build cd images directly.
21:03 < mrvn> ~half the size of the official ones.

21:50 < mrvn> didn't you generate the package lists from Packages file on the fly?
21:53 < mrvn> Do you mean /usr/share/cdebootstrap/sid/packages?
21:56 < waldi> yes
21:57 < mrvn> Do you think any other package needs those files and would conflict with cdebootstrap?
21:59 < Wile_E> Sesse: tried your patched cdebconf with the partconf bug?
22:01 < waldi> no, split them may make it possible to change the config without needs to rebuild anything
22:01 < Wile_E> Arrogance: re your debootstrap problem. debootstrap fails if it would overwrite files in /target. i.e. if there is already an installation or parts of it, you will encounter that error
22:02 < Arrogance> ya, I blew away the file.  It's messed.  I'll wait a few days and see if it shakes itself out
22:04 < Sesse> Wile_E: no, I've just compiled it and saw that that worked :-)
22:04 < Sesse> haven't tested properly yet
22:04 < mrvn> waldi: cdebootstrap is 31K. Howlong does it take to build? 1 minute?

22:59 < vorlon> Yes, it's make-kpkg compatible.
23:01 < Wile_E> amck: we are recieving many installation reports where ppl would prefer to have the keyboard question asked...
23:01 < Wile_E> amck: should we reconsider to bump the question to high?
23:06 < amck> I think we should instead ask the debconf priority question immediately after languagechooser.
23:07 < amck> Otherwisse the same issue appears everywhere we add defaults: choose-mirror, clever dhcp' netcfg, etc.
23:07 < amck> We should ask the question, not just document it on the first screen; people don't read unless you force them to ;-)
23:08 < Wile_E> amck: yeah, people do not like reading... ;-)
23:08 < amck> Hmm. Only just catching up with debian-boot. Lots of reports recently, and I've been busy at work.
23:10 < amck> I would change the menu-item value for cdebconf-priority now, but want to get agreement on this first.
23:10 < mrvn> I don't see anything in netcfg that should behave differently dependng on the priority.
23:10 < mrvn> The merged netcfg that is.
23:11 < mrvn> Needs a new debconf widget though.
23:11 < amck> If we implement dhcp-by-default, people are going to complain that they didn't get to set a static address ...
23:11 < mrvn> amck: probe dhcp, fill in the results, present the results in a widget where the user can edit them.
23:12 < mrvn> or select retry dhcp or back or finish.
23:12 < amck> Ditto for almost any automatic action ; eg. people complaining that it loaded CD modules automatically, never letting them download the flashy new super-jtf partitioning module, etc.
23:13 < amck> mrvn: agreed (I'd just picked netcfg as an example for priority questions).
23:13 < mrvn> amck: "install additional d-i modules" should be in the chain somewhere.
23:13 < mrvn> As for downloading stuff from the net when using a cd I say thats their own fault. If they want a net image they should download a net image.
23:13 < amck> mrvn: it is, and you'll see it on low priority; I'm saying if your install is going well, and nothing fails, you may never see main-menu ...
23:14 < mrvn> amck: Should be high then.
23:14 < mrvn> Or there should be a general install planer where you can select the way you want to go.
23:15 < Wile_E> amck: we need an agreement on how to decide which menu-entries the user get to se (prio=high) and which not
23:15 < amck> mrvn: which? main-menu? if cdebconf-priority is immediately after languagechooser (value 12?) then it will be asked. Default to high.
23:15 < mrvn> I don't think any static priority will cut it.
23:16 < amck> Wile_E: Agreed. The trouble is, we want to (1) show the user they can change things (by selecting a different priority), then (2) do as much automatically as possible.
23:16 < mrvn> If discover finds some hardware without module the "install additional debian modules" menu should pop up and ask the user to choose some.
23:17 < robertj> can someone help me out for a second, I don't have a sarge box handy
23:17 < amck> mrvn: yes. The issue is for other non-hardware modules: eg. a jfs-support module, etc.
23:17 < robertj> is the default mta already exim4?
23:17 < Wile_E> amck: agreed. but i favour for asking question which meet the following criteria: although they have a sane defualt (e.g. kbd-chooser), they are easy to under stand _and_ it might be of use to change the default for a considerable amount of ppl
23:17 < mrvn> Actually I think as soon as the cd is found all modules should just be installed. period.
23:18 < amck> mrvn: memory space issues, conflicts may happen (in principle).
23:18 < mrvn> amck: install, not load.
23:19 < amck> mrvn: explain?
23:19 < mrvn> udpkg --unpack *module.udeb
23:19 < mrvn> So discover can find them all.
23:19 < amck> mrvn: Ah. kernel modules. agreed.
23:20 < mrvn> And after hardwaredetection there should be some summary before going on to partitioning.
23:20 < Wile_E> amck: note the change in terminology: modules=kernel modules, components=udebs ;-)
23:20 < amck> Yes. Thx.
23:21 < mrvn> Ah, udebs are now called components?
23:21 < Wile_E> mrvn: there was some agreement on this, and the terminology was applied to the debconf templates during the polishing procedure
23:21 < amck> mrvn: Summary : Interesting, but a bit of a rewrite at this stage. How would it work?
23:22 < Wile_E> i think it is a good idea, modules was too ambigous especially in an installer
23:22 < mrvn> amck: A simple debconf message is enough. <back> to go into main-menu and fix missing stuff and <continue> to go on.
23:23 < amck> mrvn: I mean collecting info. Eg. kbd-chooser; not all modules are present everywhere; kbd-chooser is not on s390, languagechooser not on serial, etc.
23:24 < mrvn> List the cpu, memory, hardware components (hda: Segate 80G, hdc: Plextor CD-rw), Debian-DI V4723 cd found in cdrom
23:24 < amck> mrvn: just a hw summary, then?
23:24 < amck> it could be added to the end of hw-detect.
23:24 < mrvn> amck: At that stage yes.
23:25 < mrvn> amck: That would be great. Cause if I select back and load some more kernel module components hw-detect should rerun
23:26 < mrvn> Didn't someone suggest removing network config from cdrom images? That would screw up nfs installs.
23:27 < amck> Does anyone _object_ to asking the cdebconf-priority question after languagechooser?
23:29 < Wile_E> amck: i am not sure if polishing the priorities of the question wolud be a better solution. so that "medium" would truly only be needed for really special needs
23:29 < amck> Wile_E: on kbd-chooser: I've had bug reports from users who did not know what kind of keyboard they needed, but no reports from people objecting to kbd-choosers choices _who_knew_they_could_change_it.
23:29 < mrvn> Whats the difference between medium and low (questions wise)?
23:30 < amck> mrvn: on low, you get asked for parameters for n=infinity ide modules ...#
23:30 < mrvn> amck: I think some sparc guy had problems that the keyboard was screwed and he had to select en_US again.
23:30 < mrvn> amck: do they even have any?
23:30 < amck> mrvn: interesting; didn't see that one.
23:31 < Wile_E> amck: well not knowing what to choose is solved with setting the default to the language. however the keyboard question is even asked on a windows intallation and in kde!
23:31 < mrvn> Sounded like a broken keymap though.
23:31 < amck> mrvn: some wierd ide modules require parameters like irq, etc.
23:31 < mrvn> amck: and some actually realy do to work.
23:31 < Wile_E> mrvn: low prints out useless notes iirc ;-)
23:32 < mrvn> I would realy like to see cdebconf widgets that ask multiple questions. Esspecialy for changing stuff.
23:33 < Wile_E> mrvn: like the gtk frontend? ;-)
23:33 < mrvn> Display a list of all questions of the package wh current answeres and when I select one pop up the acual question dialog.
23:33 < mrvn> Wile_E: gtk hat multiple questions at once? I thought it was just a nice textmode
23:34 < Wile_E> mrvn: asking multiple questions is within the debconf specification. just use multiple INPUTs before a GO. however the frontends interpret as single questions
23:34 < Wile_E> mrvn: it was about the only advantag the gtk frontend had above other frontends...
23:35 < mrvn> Thats what I would like to have. (for debconf too).
23:35 < mrvn> Going through something like the X questions sucks.
23:36 < Wile_E> mrvn: as said: it is within the debconf specification. it is up to the frontends to handle that
23:36 < mrvn> I know.
23:37 < Wile_E> well, gotta have a beer, cu later
23:37 < mrvn> Anyone build images with get-packages yet?
23:40 < robertj> Wile_E: I don't have a sid box handy, can you check and see whether exim4 is properly debconfized yet?
23:41 < amck> Does anyone know if floppy installs work fine on ppc at the moment?

21:22 < zoso> no :/ i need bc5700 module :/
21:23 < liiwi> tg3 handles that
21:23 < liiwi> just need new enough version
21:23 < zoso> hmmm
21:24 < liiwi> unless broadcom pushed out new chips with same name recently
21:25 < zoso> maybe the problem is that on other machine with mandrake
21:25 < zoso> lspci shows that it's 'rev 03'
21:25 < zoso> and on mandrake they use this bcm5700 module
21:26 < mrvn> zoso: there is neither a bcm* nor *5700 module in linux-kernel-di
21:27 < zoso> The Linux kernel includes the tg3 driver for these types of chipsets. Unfortunately, as of 2.4.22 (and 2.6.0-test4) this particular chip is not supported.

20:49 < Sesse> _Description: Load drivers from floppy now?
20:49 < Sesse>  You probably need to load drivers from a floppy before continuing with the
20:49 < Sesse>  installation. If you know that the install will work without extra
20:49 < Sesse>  drivers, you can skip this step.
20:49 < Sesse> why "probably"?

20:34 < j_k> Well, IMHO ideally anna should be passed the name of the udeb calling it (load-installer, load-iso, ...) as well as the retriever to use, to instanciate its templates, but maybe it's not time to change this.

21:27 < waldi> hmm
21:28 < waldi> yes, i should define the mode correctly
21:39 < mrvn> waldi: hardcoded to woody?
21:40 < mrvn> waldi: If you give me the source I can build m68k, alpha and mips.
21:40 < mrvn> And better hardcode to sarge if you can't make it use the release name.
21:41 < waldi> i just needs to ask debconf
21:42 < pere> waldi: why do one need to remove run-debootstrap if cdebootstrap is replacement compatible with debootstrap?
21:43 < pere> waldi: When I write "replacement compatible", I mean using the exact same arguments, and printing the exact same messages on output.
21:43 < mrvn> waldi: cdebootstrap could provide debootstrap and the binary.
21:45 < pere> if it is made to be replacement compatible, it will be a lot easier to test it, and it will have better chance of replacing the current debootstrap.
21:45 < mrvn> pere: or you need to replace run-debootstrap with run-cdebootstrap
21:47 < waldi> pere: the standard fronten is compatible, the debconf frontend can't
21:47 < mrvn> waldi: why?
21:48 < waldi> mrvn: debootstrap don't use debconf
21:49 < mrvn>     args[0] = "/usr/sbin/debootstrap";
21:49 < mrvn> What happens if you change that to cdebootstrap?
21:50 < waldi> nothing if it uses popen
21:51 < mrvn> it uses a pipe and fork/exec
21:51 < mrvn> cdebootstrap would install but progress would be broken, right?
21:51 < waldi> yes, replace run-debootstrap with cdebootstrap
21:52 < mrvn> no, when I replace debootstrap with cdebootstrap
21:52 -!- harsha [~harsha@61.11.60.52] has left #debian-boot []
21:52 < waldi> run-debootstrap translates the debootrstrap output into debconf commands
21:53 < mrvn> which cdebootstrap doesn't have so the progress will be broken.
21:53 < mrvn> right?
21:53 < waldi> ne, cdebootstrap does that themsel
21:53 < mrvn> hmm, the deb doesn't.
21:54 < mrvn> Did you write a new main for the udeb?
21:55 < mrvn> the debconf stuff is in frontend/debian-installer?
21:55 < waldi> yes
21:56 < mrvn> Why do you allway use true to signal a failure?
21:56 < waldi> i use != 0
21:58 < mrvn>   if (suite_read (configdir))
21:58 < mrvn>     frontend_message_die (FRONTEND_MESSAGE_ERROR_INTERNAL, "read config", NULL);
21:58 < mrvn> Thats uncommon
21:58 < waldi> thats rather common, just look into the libc
21:58 < mellum> C should really have exceptions. Or at least continuation :)
21:58 < waldi> continuatios?
21:59 < mellum> waldi: yes. call/cc
21:59 < mrvn> mellum: continuations play havok with the stack
21:59 < mrvn> setjmp/longjmp is a mess
21:59 < mellum> mrvn: well, you can just heap-allocate the frames
21:59 < waldi> mellum: hmm?
21:59 < mellum> waldi: never mind...
21:59 < mrvn> mellum: You need to reference count or garbage collect them
22:00 < mellum> mrvn: right.
22:00 < mrvn> mellum: setjmp/longjmp is only valid within the function doing the setjmp.
22:00 < mellum> mrvn: yes, they are not proper continuations
22:01 < mrvn> you can do proper continuations with setjmp/longjmp and signals
22:01 < mrvn> signals to change the stack
22:02 < mrvn> waldi: I wish you would use bool
22:03 < mrvn>     snprintf (real, PATH_MAX, "%s/%s", name, entry->d_name);
22:03 < mrvn> waldi: That should be checked for a path overflow.
22:05 < mrvn> Does snprintf write the trailing \0 when it truncates?
22:06 < waldi> yes
22:06 < mrvn> Where does it say that or did you just test it?
22:06 < waldi> man snprintf
22:08 < mrvn> The functions snprintf and vsnprintf do not write more  than
22:08 < mrvn>        size  bytes (including the trailing '\0').  If the output was truncated
22:08 < mrvn>        due to this limit then the return value is  the  number  of  characters
22:08 < mrvn>        (not  including the trailing '\0') which would have been written to the
22:08 < mrvn>        final string if enough space had been available.
22:08 < mrvn> For me that doesn't say if it will truncate to size-1 and add \0 or not.
22:08 < mellum> no, it always terminates
22:09 < mellum> you're probably confusing it with strncpy
22:10 < mellum> "the use of snprintf with  early  libc4  leads  to serious security problems." Oh, dammit! we should never use it!
22:12 < mrvn> waldi: if you have a recursive link and the path length just matches PATH_MAX it will loop till the stack overlows and segfault.
22:13 < waldi> where?
22:14 < waldi> realpath?
22:14 < mrvn> suite_read: 177
22:15 < mrvn> or wait, S_ISDIR prohibits recursing into links.
22:15 < mrvn> You would need a real dir structure thats too deep.
22:15 < waldi> it don't read them recursive
22:16 < mrvn>       ret |= suite_read_config (entry->d_name, real);
22:16 < mrvn> Thats recursion.
22:16 < waldi> suite_read_config never calls suite_read
22:16 < mrvn> ah, sorry.
22:16 < mrvn> why do you have so similar names?
22:19 < mrvn> waldi: does the cdebootstrap progress resize all the time like the debootstrap progress did?
22:19 < waldi> ?
22:20 < mrvn> debootstrap did print the full path for each package and libtextwrap would wrap that inot 1, 2 or even 3 lines and resize the progress widget.
22:21 < waldi> P: Downloading pool/main/libt/libtext-charwidth-perl/libtext-charwidth-perl_0.04-1_i386.deb
22:21 < waldi> P: Validating libtext-charwidth-perl_0.04-1_i386.deb
22:22 < waldi> maybe i should split the first message on the last /
22:22 < mrvn> split to basename. Then split to name_version_arch.deb and show "name version"
22:24 < mrvn> When you install from cd do you copy the debs to /target/var/cache/archive?
22:24 < waldi> it uses the retrievers to obtain anything
22:25 < waldi> and it is currently not possible to decide which to use
22:25 < mrvn> And the cd-retriver does what? copy or link?
22:26 < mrvn> Some people complained about the space wasted by the cache for small mediums like mbedded systems.

22:31 < mrvn> sources.list.udeb .local I mean
22:31 < pere> ?
22:31 < pere> I should create a sources.list.udeb.local ?
22:32 < mrvn> get-packages needs two sources.lists so poor joey doesn't have to download the big Packages file for debs just to build floppies.
22:32 < mrvn> Normaly sources.list.udeb should contain the right entry by itself.
22:33 < mrvn> Do you get the udebs from a different source than your system fetches debs from?
22:36 < pere> I get most udebs from my debian mirror, and languagechooser from the skolelinux d-i apt source.
22:37 < pere> at least I used to.  Now I get everything from the mirror, and that is no good.
22:40 < pere> mrvn: thanks.  now it work as it should. :)

22:47 < waldi> no
22:47 < mrvn> is anyone building a gpg udeb to Release.gpg can be used to verify?
22:47 < mrvn> s/to/so/
22:48 < pere> mrvn: we use a shorter language list.
22:49 < pere> mrvn: we also sort it using the no_NO locale, but that is a minor detail. :)
22:49 < mrvn> I still think languagechooser should ask for the language first and then the dialect.
22:51 < pere> mrvn: for what it is worth, RedHat agrees with me that the list should be one large list. :)
22:51 < mrvn> pere: Ihave to skip 4 english, 3 french, 2 something else and then I have 4 times german.
22:52 < mrvn> Its confusing.
22:52 < mrvn> Makes the list 3 times as long
22:54 < amck> Adding arabic means you'll have to skip most of the first page before you see non-Arabic :-)
22:54 < pere> all your points are valid, but
22:55 < mrvn> We have 47 entries 30 languages in cvs.
22:55 < mrvn> 30 is still too long a list to fit on screen
22:56 < pere> I believe that every extra question and dialog slow down the install process.  Each require the user to read the text and to choose what to select.  With only one question, the cognitive effort is redused to only one task, instead of several.
22:56 < mrvn> Could we group them by something more general than the name?
22:56 < pere> if you have good suggestions for the sorting order, there is a bug in BTS to discuss it.
22:57 < pere> cdebconf do not support grouping as far as I know.
22:57 < mrvn> Japanese and chinese fall somewhat into one group. Bosnian, Czech, Hungarian, Lithuanian, Slovak, Slovenian are a group too, or not?
22:58 < mrvn> pere: But you have to read a realy large screen instead of a small one and a submenu.
22:58 < pere> you might want to suggest some acceptable grouping system for langauges, but I do not think you will be able to get it accepted by all the language users in Debian.
22:59 < mrvn> I don't want two complete dialogs with 2 text. I want one dialog with the main language "Select this to continue in english" and when you select it a submenu pops up with "Australian, India, USA, United Kingdom"
23:00 < mrvn> That would reduce the repetivness in the languagechooser and clean up a fair bit already.
23:00 < mrvn> Do we actually have translations for all the languages?
23:01 < pere> In debian, or in d-i?
23:01 < mrvn> d-i
23:02 < pere> probably not.  But the language/region choice affect more then the translation language in d-i, so it is not too relevant.

23:09 < mrvn> I realy hate the choice. I need german keyboard for bochs but I realy don't want german language.
23:13 < pere> mrvn: the next kbd-chooser will provide the keyboard question by default.
23:14 < mrvn> Does the dialect change more than the keyboard layout?
23:15 < mrvn> German (Germany);de_DE@euro;de;DE;de_DE:de:en_GB:en
23:15 < mrvn> Whats the syntax here?
23:15 < mrvn> Text, LANG, language, dialect, name:keymap:name:keymap ?
23:16 < pere> mrvn: it is not really dialect, it is region.  It affects default timezone as well.
23:17 < pere> it is text;locale;language;country;fallback-languages
23:18 < pere> the syntax is documented in README.trans, I think.
23:18 < mrvn> Isn't en the ultimate fallback?
23:18 < pere> yes, en is always the last fallback.
23:18 < pere> no idea why it is listed for some choices.
23:18 < mrvn> Should be there for all entries or none then
23:20 < pere> actually, I guess the 'en' translation chould be different from the "no translation" choice.  At least that is the trick I use in languagechooser to display localized options with many languages.
23:24 < mrvn> And no translation would be greek or what?
23:25 < mellum> No, hebrew of course.
23:26 < pere> no translation is the original template text.  It can only use ASCII (limitation of gettext and po), while the translations can use the full ISO-10646 reportoare.

21:00 < mrvn> 50MB with base that is, not like the official businesscrad one
21:02 < mellum> base fits into 50MB?
21:02 < mrvn> sure. base debs are ~30Mb
21:03 < mellum> Oh. Cool.
21:03 < mrvn> ~12 MB for udebs and some bootimages
21:03 < mrvn> Probably 60MB for alpha
21:03 < mrvn> mellum: just look at the image you have on your disk.

14:59 < Kovi> for example: udpkg: error while loading shared libraries: libdebian-installer.so.4:
14:59 < Kovi> cannot open object file: No such file or directory not.
14:59 < Sesse> what sarge DVD images? there are no official sarge DVD images

20:41 < Sesse> the bts is pseudo-up.

12:11 < pere> joeyh: I noticed your agressive plan to get the next beta out.  I am not sure there will be enough time to test all the changes that will be commited to CVS once CVS is working.

12:13 < waldi> pere: ask aj for nmu approval
12:14 < pere> I can not NMU every package under the sun.  I do not have time left to keep an eye on them after the NMU.
