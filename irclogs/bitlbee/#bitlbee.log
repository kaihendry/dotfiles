13:09 <@hendry> Jamie: I have not heard of Eclipse. So, that can't be bad mind.
13:09 <@hendry> Oksana: I had a few beers at Marcin's.
13:09 < Jamie> hendry: hu?
13:10 <@hendry> Jamie: if I hear about an ISP, it is usually bad news
13:10 < Jamie> hendry: ah
13:10 < Jamie> hendry: demon weren't featured on adslguide
13:10 < Jamie> hendry: demon would have saved me 25 :(
13:13 <@hendry> Jamie: they are the best UK isp imo.
13:16 <@hendry> Jamie: also make sure the modem you get, is not the cheap proprietary windows only driver sort !!!!
13:17 < Jamie> hendry: hehe
13:17 < Jamie> hendry: I already got one :)
13:17 <@hendry> Jamie: is it scum ?
13:20 < Jamie> hendry: yes
13:20 < Jamie> hendry: well.....
13:20 < Jamie> hendry: there's this web site see
13:20 < Jamie> hendry: http://www.mbsi.ca/cnxtlindrv/
13:20 < Jamie> hendry: but I think that's only dial up modems
13:21 <@hendry> Jamie: nasty nasty soft modems
13:22 <@hendry> Jamie: did you actually go out and buy it? Or it was given to you?
13:22 < Jamie> hendry: well, I virtually went out and bought it on ebuyer.com
13:23 < Jamie> hendry: all the ones they give you are usb modems
13:23 < Jamie> hendry: the one I have is pci
13:23 < Jamie> hendry: and it was 25

13:30 <@hendry> Laurad: yes... reading
13:31 < Laurad> hendry: tell me more about your trip to germany
13:31 <@hendry> Laurad: I will probably stay the weekend Laura. Make the most of it.
13:31 <@hendry> Laurad: my friend willi, will most likely too busy to entertain me, don't you think ?
13:31 <@hendry> Laurad: I guess I come by boat... (not sure)
13:32 < Laurad> hendry: where will you stay overnight?
13:32 <@hendry> Jamie: that guide sucks. Dedicated ADSL routers are best. Why steal CPU cycles? And give yourself all sorts of other problems
13:33 < Jamie> hendry: jeez Kai, pcs are so powerful nowadays
13:33 < Jamie> hendry: who needs a few cpu cycles here and there?
13:33 <@hendry> Laurad: He says he can I arrange something. And he also said that it would be OK to have a friend !
13:33 < Jamie> hendry: I mean, even at 500k/s that's still so much slower than even the slowest networks
13:34 < Laurad> hendry: sounds good
13:34 < Laurad> hendry: i guess i will drive up. will be nice to see you
13:34 <@hendry> Jamie: Computers aren't powerful nowadays. Esp. if you run Java. Also, more the point, is that dedicated routers are *easy*. Just plugin and go. Not open case, setup *wanky* drivers... 
13:34 <@hendry> Laurad: =)
13:34 <@hendry> Laurad: =)

13:35 < Jamie> hendry: you think 3 GHz isn't powerful?

13:35 <@hendry> Jamie: try crack me a 128 bit RSA key
13:35 < Jamie> hendry: and I not only run java, but program in it too
13:35 <@hendry> Jamie: try run a java servlet
13:36 <@hendry> Jamie: anyway, that is not the point....

16:42 < Mike_Cave> hendry: better in almost every way i would say, other than the fact that I don't know enough people, and its impossible to meet new people in a place like this, but there's a hell of a lot more shit going down here, always killer entertainment
16:42 <@hendry> Mike_Cave: webpage Vignette? tables, javascript, no doctype. bad man !

16:46 < Mike_Cave> hendry: drugs are plentiful aswell
16:46 <@hendry> Mike_Cave: you are into that?
16:46 < Mike_Cave> hendry: no, well just weed, i don't really consider that "a drug"
16:47 < Mike_Cave> hendry: but thats open to debate
16:47 < Mike_Cave> hendry: my digsmates are bad influences though, they keep prodding me to do all this other shit with them, one day i may just let my guard done and be a victim of some serious peer pressure :)
16:47 <@hendry> Mike_Cave: ah well. I don't smoke. I tried. Tried xtc. That was an evil drug. Making me unjustifyingly love some people I did not even know
16:47 < Mike_Cave> hendry: hehe, and alcahol doesn't do that?
16:47 <@hendry> Mike_Cave: peer pressure is the worst.
16:48 <@hendry> Mike_Cave: alcohol is worse, but accepted
16:49 < Mike_Cave> hendry: yeah, thats the only thing which pisses me off, alcohol is accepted by everyone, but weed isn't, and i've had large experience in both departments and i can honestly say without a shadow of a doubt alcohol is far more abusive to ones body
16:50 < Mike_Cave> hendry: went to graduation last weekend, flip, didn't realise how much i missed varsity till i went back for 3 days of solid partying, damn...

16:54 <@hendry> Mike_Cave: Why Joeburg? (And CT to a lesser extent) 
16:55 < Mike_Cave> hendry: cos joburg is HOOGE now, everything else is dieing, other towns arn't growing, everyone just flocks here
16:55 < Mike_Cave> hendry: i read some stats and joburg is apparently bigger than LA now

17:04 < Mike_Cave> hendry: hehe, i'm into my exercise
17:05 <@hendry> Mike_Cave: Do you have a webpage?
17:05 < Mike_Cave> hendry: nope, couldn't be bothered to do anything in my spare time other than purely recreational activities :)
17:06 < Mike_Cave> hendry: fuck, i wanted to get next friday off, cos the thursday is a public hol, and i know this group of chicks going on a roadtrip to durbs, 3 chicks and me....GTS (guaranteed to score)...but they won't give me the day off, cos the rest of my team has the day off, and one person has to stay behind!!!*&^^*&
17:06 <@hendry> Mike_Cave: you sound a little like a hedonist
17:07 < Mike_Cave> hendry: i am
17:07 < Mike_Cave> hendry: well kinda i suppose
17:07 <@hendry> Mike_Cave: GTS? hehe. So you hear much from Tim et al? Bryan?
17:08 < Mike_Cave> hendry: not much from bryan, see tim quit regularly
17:08 < Mike_Cave> hendry: quite
17:08 <@hendry> Mike_Cave: whats the gossip on Tim? What is he upto ?
17:10 < Mike_Cave> hendry: not much that i know of, haven't seen that much of him yet really, i only bin in joburg 2 months, and hes bin going home on all the long weekends, so haven't hooked up much, got plans too though, cos him and all his digsmates go to this club which i want to go to, just haven't had anyone to go with, so as soon as he is back for a weekend we will go
17:10 < Mike_Cave> hendry: hes also working at a small software company, not too far from here
17:11 < Mike_Cave> hendry: also renting a room in a house like myself
17:11 < Mike_Cave> hendry: quite a nice setup we got
17:11 <@hendry> Mike_Cave: any linux stuff going on? South African Linux User Group?? 
17:11 <@hendry> Mike_Cave: what is the setup ?
17:12 <@hendry> Mike_Cave: also what Games are you into? I would like to play a game tonight I think...
17:12 < Mike_Cave> hendry: don't know, not into linux myself, but its not that big here
17:12 < Mike_Cave> hendry: 
17:12 < Mike_Cave> hendry: nice pad, renting a room in a pretty fancy house, no start up costs, decent digsmates, everyone can live their own lives if they want too to (stay out of each others ways)
17:13 < Mike_Cave> hendry: games...hmmm...well, pretty much anything, bin playing alot of quake3 recently just cos there is a huge tourney this weekend and i wanna come somewhere, just started playing splintercell too
17:13 < Mike_Cave> hendry: and freelancer
17:14 <@hendry> Mike_Cave: free lancer? Must look into that. 
17:14 <@hendry> Mike_Cave: shame you are not into linux man
17:14 < Mike_Cave> hendry: how come?
17:15 < Mike_Cave> hendry: whats the big deal with it?
17:15 < Mike_Cave> hendry: never much understood
17:17 < Mike_Cave> hendry: arg, u know how far behind RSA is in terms of inet bandwidth...we still don't have anything suitable for the local software pirate
17:18 <@hendry> Mike_Cave: so many reasons
17:18 < Mike_Cave> hendry: name em~
17:18 < Mike_Cave> hendry: !
17:18 <@hendry> Mike_Cave: sorry lost net connection
17:19 <@hendry> Mike_Cave: there are LOADS
17:19 <@hendry> Mike_Cave: Google for : Why Linux
17:19 <@hendry> Mike_Cave: opensource. better security. faster. you name it. we have it.
17:21 < Mike_Cave> hendry: half life 2 info is starting to do the rounds
17:21 < Mike_Cave> hendry: think it gonna clash head on with doom3
17:23 <@hendry> Mike_Cave: I don't believe in sequels. I think HL won't be undone. Like QW was never outdone
17:24 < Mike_Cave> hendry: quake 1 rocked
17:24 <@hendry> Mike_Cave: id has a native linux port of doom3 and John Carmack. My money is on id 
17:24 < Mike_Cave> hendry: but so did all the quakes i suppose
17:24 < Mike_Cave> hendry: they'll both style
17:24 <@hendry> Mike_Cave: what is your video card then ??
17:26 < Mike_Cave> hendry: ti 4200
17:26 < Mike_Cave> hendry: should scrape by, depending on how long it is before these games are released
17:26 <@hendry> Mike_Cave: I am a little surprised you are still into gaming. After god knows how many years... I play myself too, but rarely. I such so I get frustrated too I guess, which does not help.
17:27 < Mike_Cave> hendry: i'm mostly only into multiplayer gaming now
17:27 < Mike_Cave> hendry: which is still cool
17:27 <@hendry> Mike_Cave: always ! 
17:27 < Mike_Cave> hendry: single player, well usually only when i get stoned :) then its still interesting, but other than that interest is definitely waning
17:28 <@hendry> Mike_Cave: Ok, I am going home. Need to do some shopping...
17:28 < Mike_Cave> hendry: have fun
