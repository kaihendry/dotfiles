00:00 <@NoVisAnima> are you trying to accuse *me*
00:03 <+Nana`> what do you think
00:04 <@NoVisAnima> i think you're being cheeky
00:05 <@NoVisAnima> i'm innocent
00:05 <+Nana`> whatever
00:05 <@NoVisAnima> O_O
00:07 <@NoVisAnima> *mutter* *mutter* you're mean *mutter* *mutter*
00:09 <@NoVisAnima> *giggles*
00:09 <@NoVisAnima> i'm in a far too good mood, ok so i didn't get much work done, but i've half written my review of the year.
00:09 <@NoVisAnima> It's made me feel all good inside
00:09 <+Nana`> review of the year?
00:10 <@NoVisAnima> yeah, since this year hasn't sucked like the ones before it
00:10 <@NoVisAnima> i've actually got things worthwhile remembering in it
00:10 <@NoVisAnima> so i'm just writing them down

00:30 <@NoVisAnima> oh
00:30 <@NoVisAnima> small FYI
00:30 <@NoVisAnima> flo has discovered that he legally cant get back into his own country because his id card has run out
00:30 <@Krypt0n> LOL
00:30 <+nana-> nooooooo
00:31 <+nana-> make him go away
00:31 <@NoVisAnima> oh he can leave
00:31 <@NoVisAnima> just when he lands
00:31 <@NoVisAnima> we think either a) he'll have to wait around for a card
00:31 <@Krypt|LpTp> flo stuck in the UK all xmas, on his own... ohh dear
00:32 <@NoVisAnima> b) get taken by german police and locked up
00:32 <@NoVisAnima> c) get a fine
00:32 <@NoVisAnima> he can leave the country cos all he needs is his passport
00:32 <@NoVisAnima> it's the getting out of the air port the other end
00:32 <@NoVisAnima> ~:D
00:32 <@Krypt0n> hmm
00:32 <@NoVisAnima> apparently it takes 6 weeks to get a new card

00:40 <@NoVisAnima> hmm, maybe i should go for an early night
00:40 <@NoVisAnima> so i'm more awake tomorrow
00:41 <+nana-> what's tomorrow
00:41 <@NoVisAnima> sunday
00:41 <+nana-> well duh
00:41 <@NoVisAnima> exactly my point
00:42 <@NoVisAnima> with more awakedness i can get more work done over a greater period of time
00:42 <@NoVisAnima> rather than spending the time in a dream like state the entire time
00:42 <@NoVisAnima> which helps when i'm thinking about the solutions to problems, but doesn't help in their implementation
00:43 <+nana-> i have figured out how to do lisp
00:43 <+nana-> it's just a case of doingit tomorrow
00:43 <@NoVisAnima> ~:)
00:43 <@NoVisAnima> lisp isn't *too* bad ~:P
00:43 <@NoVisAnima> it could be worse
00:44 <@NoVisAnima> pity i ended up doing it all in the last moments, in truth i almost didn't get any of it done
00:45 <@NoVisAnima> hmm, my work pattern has actually been the same as last year, though this time they understand me
00:46 <+nana-> i dreamt about zombies the other day
00:46 <+nana-> i dreamt a zombie was going to eat me
00:46 <+nana-> and i was trying to reason with him and saying "look, i know you have a heartbeat jsut for fun,but i *really* need mine...would you mind not biting me?"
00:46 <+nana-> and i went to shake hands with this zombie
00:47 <+nana-> and it bit me
00:48 <@NoVisAnima> what colour was the zombie?
00:48  * Krypt|LpTp considers finding dinner
00:48 <@draq> Kamakaze: lo?
00:48 <@NoVisAnima> LOL
00:49 <+nana-> I dont know
00:49 <+nana-> person coloured
00:50 <@NoVisAnima> ~:)
00:50 <@NoVisAnima> i was just thinking
00:53 <+nana-> shaaaaaakeaawayyyy pwnz
00:54 <@NoVisAnima> indeed they do, but i really haven't been enough times
00:54 <@NoVisAnima> i dont spend enough time in town

17:40  * Nana` is completely stuck
17:40 <@NoVisAnima> ok
17:40 <@NoVisAnima> what are you trying to do?
17:41 <+Nana`> test if something is a bound variable
17:41 -!- |31770|afk is now known as |31770|
17:41 <+Nana`> i just dont know what test to do
17:41  * Nana` has a complete mental block
17:41 <+|31770|> [14:41] <Krypt0n> |31770|afk :: do you do fencing? ||| no but im the gear sec for the mountaineering club if u know me
17:42 <+Nana`> |31770| what was your function again?
17:42 <@NoVisAnima> lx.xqwx <- surely you can check if x is in the xqwx bit
17:43 <+Nana`> yeh but that doesnt necessarily mean its bound
17:43 <+Nana`> e.g. Lx.xy
17:43 <@NoVisAnima> x is still a bound var surely
17:43 <+Nana`> yeah but y isnt
17:43 <+Nana`> yet it is in the body
17:44 <@NoVisAnima> but it isn't next to teh lambda
17:44 <@NoVisAnima> which is the check you need to do
17:44 <+Nana`> eh?
17:44 <@NoVisAnima> surely
17:44 <+Nana`> I dont get you
17:44 <+|31770|> (defun bound (x l-term) (if (l-test(l-term)) (if (eq (second l-term) x) #t #f)(bound (x (cdr l-term)))))
17:45 <+|31770|> dont know if it will work yet
17:46  * Nana` looks at it
17:47 <+Nana`> if it's a lambda, and the thing youre trying to test is in the arg, true
17:47 <+Nana`> else false
17:47 <+Nana`> surely the else false should be the (bound (x (cdr l-term))) bit?
17:48 <+|31770|> test if the 1st part of the lambda term is l
17:49 <+|31770|> then test if the second elemnt of the term is x
17:49 <+|31770|> if thats true then x is bound
17:49  * Nana` nods
17:49 <+Nana`> what if it is Lx.y
17:49 <+|31770|> else test for more lambdas in the list
17:49 <+|31770|> the the x is still bound its just not in the body
17:49 <+Nana`> is x still bound
17:49 <+Nana`> ah
17:49 <+Nana`> ok
17:50 <+|31770|> function tests if x is bound not if x is bound and in the body, but its not working :/
17:50 <@NoVisAnima> heh, makes it easier
17:50 <+Nana`> but i thought to be bound it had to be in the body of the argument and in the formal argument
17:50 <+|31770|> getting a type error and lisp dont even have types
17:51 <@NoVisAnima> i think it does have types, just it decideds what type something is when you try and do something to it
17:51 <+|31770|> well im testing if x would be bound if its in the body as whenu alpha rename u only rename bound varibles
17:51 <+|31770|> if nothing is bound u rename nothing so it dont matter
17:51 <+Nana`> oh, point :)
17:52  * Nana` beavers away
17:52 <@NoVisAnima> also checking if something is bound is handy when you want to replace other stuff
17:52 <@NoVisAnima> you dont want to replace stuff with something bound
17:52 <@NoVisAnima> IIRC
17:52 <+|31770|> yeh
17:53 <+Nana`> Um
17:53 <@NoVisAnima> um?
17:53 <+Nana`> if youre testing if something is a lambda (i.e. the first thing is a L) you would use equal, right?
17:53 <+Nana`> like (if (equal (car exp) 'L) ...)
17:53 <+Nana`> because it looks the same
17:53 <+Nana`> rather than eq being structurally the same
17:53 <+|31770|> i am using eq which i think is right but that could be y its not working
17:53 <@NoVisAnima> heh i never had to check tat
17:54 <+Nana`> eq means it is identical in structure
17:54 <+Nana`> i just looked it up in the notes
17:54 <@NoVisAnima> because i structrured my lambda terms in such a way
17:54 <+|31770|> ah
17:54  * |31770| hopes this will work now
17:55 <@NoVisAnima> so things were found with several cadrs and cddrs

18:16 <@NoVisAnima> you've always got to make sure both bits are correct

18:51 <+Nana`> so the first part never is true
18:52 <+Nana`> i.e. cdr of (L x y) would be (x y)

18:52 <+Nana`> isnt it?

18:52 <@NoVisAnima> i think cadr is x

19:08 <@NoVisAnima> again i remind people: NO ONE ELSE HAS HEARD THIS SYSTEM
19:09 <+Krypt0n> best sig:noise, but slightly off from the cd level
19:09 <@NoVisAnima> oh and you dont go to max volume
19:10 <@NoVisAnima> because you get distortion at about 10 below max
19:10 <@NoVisAnima> and my ears cant cope with it at about 20 below
19:10 <+Krypt0n> nah

19:15 <@NoVisAnima> well
19:15 <@NoVisAnima> i output at 70%

19:17 <+Krypt0n> it's taking ages

19:18 <+Nana`> it says everything is true
19:18 <@NoVisAnima> oh the other thing that means i dont have this up loud

19:34 <+Nana`> It would. But sadly, life sucks and no one does what you want them to do. So I'll carry on.
19:34 <@NoVisAnima> depends on how you tell people to do things you want them to do
19:35 <+Nana`> Well of course
19:35 <@NoVisAnima> that and what you're telling them to do
19:36 <+Nana`> Yeah, but if you have people who never do anything except sit on their arse all day you're kinda screwed
19:36 <@NoVisAnima> it also depends on how you view the people you're telling to do things

19:41 <@NoVisAnima> the art of leadership is not merely telling people to do stuff
19:41 <+Nana`> well if their desires are different, why should they care, and complain if mine are not realised
19:41 <@NoVisAnima> but to make them want to do the things you are telling them to do
19:41 <+Nana`> I don't want to tell anyone to do anything
19:42 <+Nana`> Which is a good job because I don't have to any more.
19:42 <@NoVisAnima> but sometimes the whole point of being in charge is telling people to do things
19:42 <@NoVisAnima> because that is what gets them to do it

19:57 <@NoVisAnima> i know i tried talking to you on friday and you obviously didn't really want to say a thing

19:57 <@NoVisAnima> please lets not get into being insensitive
19:57 <@NoVisAnima> we're all *far* too guilty of that
19:58 <@NoVisAnima> especially doing things without realising
19:58 <@NoVisAnima> it's the reason i currently have coursework extensions all over the place
19:58 <+Nana`> what, because youre insensitive? bollocks
19:58 <@NoVisAnima> because no one realised what they were doing to me
19:58 <+Nana`> what they were doing to you?
19:59 <+Nana`> what you were doing to yourself.
19:59 <+wibble_> anyway, i haven't spoken to you because i had nothing to say
19:59 <@NoVisAnima> yeah i'm probably completely to blame
19:59 <@NoVisAnima> but things around me didn't help
20:00 <+Nana`> wait, so youre blaming ME for the fact you havent done your coursework?
20:00 <+Nana`> oho

20:31 <+|31770|> not working still :/
20:31 <+|31770|> started 3h's ago and havnt got that one function working yet :/
20:31 <@NoVisAnima> ok
20:31 <@NoVisAnima> you tell me what it does
20:31 <@NoVisAnima> it would be best if you told me what it does without looking at the code
20:32 <+|31770|> was going to print the error
20:32 <@NoVisAnima> you know why you're written what you have
20:32 <+|31770|> its supposed to retrun true if x is a bound varible in the lambda term l-term
20:33 <+|31770|> the 1st if staement checks for the lambda
20:33 <@NoVisAnima> which will check if it's a lambda term right
20:33 <+|31770|> yeh
20:33 <+|31770|> thouhg x is a lambda term and that doenst have a lambda
20:34 <+|31770|> but then x isnt bound
20:34 <@NoVisAnima> make sure you know how many brackets get left around when you do cars and cdrs
20:35 <+|31770|> the second if tests weather net varible next to the lambda is x
20:35 <@NoVisAnima> that test works right?
20:35 <+|31770|> the it calls itself on the rest of the lambda term
20:35 <@NoVisAnima> you want to test little bits at a time
20:35 <+|31770|> yeh
20:35 <+|31770|> it all works apart fromt he recursion
20:36 <@NoVisAnima> ok
20:36 <@NoVisAnima> take a normal l-term
20:36 <@NoVisAnima> and find the cdr of it
20:36 <+|31770|> i can get it to find the bound vaiable if theres only one lambda
20:36 <@NoVisAnima> just to check that it's what you actually want
20:37 <@NoVisAnima> i'm going to guess that there's an extra set of brakets you weren't expecting
20:37 <+|31770|> yeh that works
20:37 <+|31770|> retruns what i want
20:38 <+|31770|> and if i run the function on it then it works
20:39 <@NoVisAnima> what error does it throw then?

20:43 <@NoVisAnima> so what happens if you do (bound '(x) '(l (x) (x) ) )
20:43 <+|31770|> if i take of recusion it works
20:44 <+|31770|> iwth the recusion i get the error above
20:45 <+|31770|> if i do a back trace i get :

20:46 <+|31770|> think im gonig to fail this unit :/
20:47 <@NoVisAnima> weird
20:47 <@NoVisAnima> why would the same thing be on the stack twice
20:51 <@NoVisAnima> hmm
20:51 <@NoVisAnima> i've just opened euscheme
20:51 <@NoVisAnima> and was faffing around with what the lists look ilke
20:53 <+|31770|> anything come up?
20:53 <@NoVisAnima> i dont think cdr l-term is what you want in the recursive step
20:54 <+|31770|> i tryed cddr
20:54 <+|31770|> an taht just did the same
20:54 <+|31770|> what do i want to do then?
20:57 <@NoVisAnima> hmm
20:58 <@NoVisAnima> right let me see, what it does is looks at lx.ly.xy checking if y is bound
20:59 <@NoVisAnima> it takes that finds the l and sees if x is y
20:59 <@NoVisAnima> it isn't... then i'm not sure what the function does
21:00 <@NoVisAnima> surely it should go, oops it aint i'll just check the end bit to see if that does
21:00 <@NoVisAnima> and if it cant find an L in there *then* return false
21:00 <+|31770|> thats what i think it should do
21:00 <@NoVisAnima> but that's not what your code seems to be doing
21:02 <@NoVisAnima> recurse when it fails to find that the x after the L is what ever
21:03 <@NoVisAnima> i think
21:03 <@NoVisAnima> hmm
21:04 <@NoVisAnima> there are 3 things you need to check for application , abstraction and variables. figure out what they look like and how you should handle each one, using that method for every bit of the cwk might help
21:11 <+|31770|> going to assume i will get that working at some point and move on now i think cant afford to wast anymore time
